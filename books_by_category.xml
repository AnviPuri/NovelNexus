                BestsellerFrom the bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of
                the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as
                richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a
                record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had
                declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the
                North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era’s great transatlantic “Greyhounds”—the fastest
                liner then in service—and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly
                strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. Germany, however, was
                determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was
                happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger’s U-boat, but
                told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand
                and achingly small—hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more—all converged to produce one
                of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don’t, and Erik
                Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of
                America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a
                cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female
                architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but
                also captivated by the prospect of new love.  Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama
                and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by
                history. ...more

                evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love
                affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.Chicago, 1920: Hadley
                Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she
                meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the
                pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled
                “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though
                deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill-prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age
                Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and
                competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all
                the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will
                become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of
                life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite
                their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a
                deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking
                portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the
                end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley. ...more

                as role models? Wouldn't it empower your child to know that these saints/sages are real people, some of
                whom are living right now?In "Amy Meets the Saints and Sages, A Young Person's Adventures in
                Spirituality" your child gets to meet six saints/sages from six different traditions: Islam,
                Catholicism, Judaism, Native American, Tibetan Buddhism, and Hinduism. Three of the saints/sages are
                women; three are men. Three are still with us; three have passed on. Your child is introduced to these
                saints/sages first through a brief but reverent biography. Then second, your child gets to know the
                saint/sage better through a concrete story. Children love stories and they have a way of sticking to a
                child for years. And finally, let's make it personal by having the saint/sage and a young person, about
                your child's age, fictionally interact around the story. It's all fun and engaging for both child and
                adults.It's for children age 7-12 and is fully illustrated. There is never any attempt to have your
                child join anything.And, as your child comes to appreciate various religions, a bit more religious
                tolerance is gained. With that gain a bit more peace has come forth.Find out more at

                Space is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh
                produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human.
                How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk
                for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it
                possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions,
                space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach
                discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training
                toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on
                a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth. ...more

                day, can change the course of a whole lifetime." Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member
                of the ruling caste of Pashtuns. Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised and
                impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon his friend amidst the
                increasing ethnic, religious, and political tensions of the dying years of the Afghan monarchy,
                wrenching them far apart. But so strong is the bond between the two boys that Amir journeys back to a
                distant world, to try to right past wrongs against the only true friend he ever had.The unforgettable,
                heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father’s
                servant, The Kite Runner is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being
                destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption;
                and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons—their love, their sacrifices, their lies.A sweeping
                story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of
                Afghanistan over the last thirty years, The Kite Runner is an unusual and powerful novel that has become
                a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic. ...more

                mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of
                far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their
                upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty,
                supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.When they worked together, no
                problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical
                ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money
                and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not
                even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked
                being killed.In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of
                the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters
                from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the
                little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone
                differently for them. ...more

                page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate.
                'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed
                that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. If your
                cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive? How dangerous is it, really, to be
                in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm? If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power
                could we produce? What if everyone only had one soulmate?When (if ever) did the sun go down on the
                British empire? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?What would happen if the moon
                went away?In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified
                military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His
                responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics.

                than a book for geeks, WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the
                laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter

                of Same Kind of Different as MeDo you remember the hospital, Colton? Sonja said. Yes, mommy, I remember,
                he said. That s where theangels sang to me.When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy,
                his familywas overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren t expecting, though, was the story
                that emerged in the months that followed a story as beautiful as itwas extraordinary, detailing their
                little boy s trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body
                during thesurgery and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents weredoing in
                another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked ofvisiting heaven and relayed
                stories told to him by people he met there whom hehad never met in life, sharing events that happened
                even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about
                heaven thatmatched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and
                the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes
                Jesus, the angels, how really, really big God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but
                using Colton s uniquely simple words, Heaven Is for Real offers a glimpseof the world that awaits us,
                where as Colton says, Nobody is old and nobodywears glasses.Heaven Is for Real will forever change the
                way you think of eternity, offeringthe chance to see, and believe, like a child." ...more

                someone you truly loved?--To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven
                into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for
                Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a
                tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice
                to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the
                thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain

                Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in
                New Moon and Eclipse - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever? ...more

                fifth century BCE Pherecydes and others attempted to integrate city-state stories into a coherent mythic
                Greek pre-history. Science unavailable to ancient sources helped guide author Spencer Clevenger to
                critical insights and intriguing results. In "Greek Mythic History," he weaves myths concerning gods,
                kings, and heroes into their intended time and place and offers a concise retelling of Greek myths from
                a historic perspective. Capitalizing on modern discoveries, Clevenger tells the story in chronological
                order, starting with the creation of the cosmos and ending in the Dark Ages when poets began to write
                down their myths and stories. Neither history nor mythology, the stories depict what history might be if
                the myths were interpreted more literally.With maps and exhibits included, "Greek Mythic History"
                provides a comprehensive retelling of the various Hellenic myths in a logical historical sequence, and
                places nearly the entire canon into context. ...more

                legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping
                coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. A high-action story written with a poet's hand, The
                Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.

                intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the
                difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer
                Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical
                not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.Casting a
                wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated
                fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's
                so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past
                lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with
                lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge
                into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms. ...more

                show host, and reality television star offers up a no-holds-barred memoir, including an eye-opening
                insider account of her tumultuous and heart-wrenching thirty-year-plus association with the Church of
                Scientology.Leah Remini has never been the type to hold her tongue. That willingness to speak her mind,
                stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to
                forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost.That
                was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of
                Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about
                that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church
                and its controversial practices.Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother
                and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress
                and advancing Scientology’s causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success
                she’d worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists
                alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology’s most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time
                directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes.But when she
                began to raise questions about some of the church’s actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she
                was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a “Suppressive Person,”
                and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners—including members of her own family—were told to
                disconnect from her. Forever.Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, Troublemaker chronicles Leah
                Remini’s remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family.
                This is a memoir designed to reveal the hard-won truths of a life lived honestly—from an author unafraid
                of the consequences. ...more

            <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding
                anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful
                wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams
                about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's dia On a warm summer morning in
                North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being
                wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears.
                Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and
                shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have
                put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s
                fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and
                inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?

                learning wasted. In my thirty-five years of experience in the oil and banking industries, including
                ascending levels of management and leadership responsibilities, I have gained what I believe to be
                valuable insight into many styles of leadership. Former President of the United States, Harry S. Truman,
                once said “It’s what you learn after you know it all that really counts.” We must continue our education
                if we want to keep pace with progress. The learning process that begins with our parents and through the
                influence of others with whom we associate continues throughout life. The insight I have received into
                what is successful has been clearly revealed through years of experience. There have been failures and
                there have been successes and it has not been difficult to discern the reasons for either. Careful
                thought has led to the extraction of the traits and characteristics that provide a leader with the best
                chance of success and they are delineated in this book. We should all be teachers and mentors and strive
                to improve the lives of those with whom we become associated. Our legacy in life is to live on through
                the lives of those we have touched. This book will enlighten you about the successful strategies I have
                employed in a myriad of situations as a leader and manager. ...more

            <description>On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and
                disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean
                surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling
                to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordin On a May afternoon in
                1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of
                debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that
                of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself
                aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name
                was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses,
                brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into
                running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of
                the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey
                that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay
                thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy
                aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer
                desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate,
                whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.In her long-awaited new
                book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit.
                Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the
                resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit. ...more

                you wouldn't be smiling.Samantha McAllister looks just like the rest of the popular girls in her junior
                class. But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends
                would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and
                worries that she can't turn off. Second-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a
                struggle, and it doesn't help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong
                outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she'd be truly crazy to leave the protection of the
                most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a
                refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam's weekly visits to her
                psychiatrist.Caroline introduces Sam to Poet's Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits
                who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a
                guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly,
                she begins to feel more "normal" than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a
                new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear. ...more

                Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on
                the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties – blind, bitterly disappointed by the
                Restoration and briefly in danger of execution – Paradise Lost’s apparent ambivalence towards authority
                has led to intense debate about whether it manages to ‘justify the ways of God to men’, or exposes the
                cruelty of Christianity.John Leonard’s revised edition of Paradise Lost contains full notes, elucidating
                Milton’s biblical, classical and historical allusions and discussing his vivid, highly original use of
                language and blank verse. ...more

                capable of uncontrollable and sometimes destructive force? Music has no concepts, it lacks images; it

                beings when they make or listen to music? What is it about music, what gives it such peculiar power over
                us, power delectable and beneficent for the most part, but also capable of uncontrollable and sometimes
                destructive force? Music has no concepts, it lacks images; it has no power of representation, it has no
                relation to the world. And yet it is evident in all of us–we tap our feet, we keep time, hum, sing,
                conduct music, mirror the melodic contours and feelings of what we hear in our movements and
                expressions.In this book, Oliver Sacks explores the power music wields over us–a power that sometimes we
                control and at other times don’t. He explores, in his inimitable fashion, how it can provide access to
                otherwise unreachable emotional states, how it can revivify neurological avenues that have been frozen,
                evoke memories of earlier, lost events or states or bring those with neurological disorders back to a
                time when the world was much richer.This is a book that explores, like no other, the myriad dimensions
                of our experience of and with music. ...more

            <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening
                to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working
                on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts
                that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s At least one-third of the people
                we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who
                innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in
                teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the great
                contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal
                computer.Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people,
                Quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the
                reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins
                seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth
                century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated
                from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of
                American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the
                leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in
                psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and
                introverts.Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane
                public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps
                into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better
                negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to
                when it makes sense to be a "pretend extrovert."This extraordinary book has the power to permanently
                change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves. ...more

                a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its
                history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the
                creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the
                power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and
                18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual
                Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.When

                a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit
                smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists
                discover, have fundamentally changed. Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making
                their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track
                to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible
                pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. An
                untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is
                attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa,
                becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. What do all these people have in common? They achieved
                success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.  They succeeded by
                transforming habits. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles
                Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how
                they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information
                into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its
                potential for transformation.  Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change,
                despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where
                neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how
                the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard
                Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target
                superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and
                see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure
                and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key
                to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building
                revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.
                 Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our
                businesses, our communities, and our lives. ...more

                Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.To complicate matters, someone
                in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is,
                what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the

                ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little
                like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world
                with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would

                Ursula rests nothing less than the fate of civilization.Wildly inventive, darkly comic, startlingly
                poignant — this is Kate Atkinson at her absolute best, playing with time and history, telling a story
                that is breathtaking for both its audacity and its endless satisfactions. ...more

                both utterly mundane and completely transcendent, pulling us out of our everyday lives and making us
                feel a part of something greater than ourselves? Taking a unique approach to this problem, the nameless

                quotidian trifles of being within a couple, giving us an indelible and deeply moving portrait of love in

            <description>Our enemy, the devil, prowls around like a lion. (1 Peter 5:8) All he wants to do is steal,
                kill and destroy (John 10:10). And much like the pattern we find in the wild, the ancient serpent will
                stalk the youngest of the flock because they’re the easiest target. So I’m writing these short readings
                to encourage new Christians during the most vulnerable part of their journey Our enemy, the devil,
                prowls around like a lion. (1 Peter 5:8) All he wants to do is steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10). And
                much like the pattern we find in the wild, the ancient serpent will stalk the youngest of the flock
                because they’re the easiest target. So I’m writing these short readings to encourage new Christians
                during the most vulnerable part of their journey.I want to remind new followers of the “Way” that the
                Christian life is best lived in community with others who are striving to follow Jesus. One of our first
                responsibilities as a new Christian is to spend as much time as possible with others who are being real
                with their faith. Just as a soldier would never go into battle alone and unarmed, we must remember that
                though our struggle is not against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), it’s still a battle. It’s important
                to make sure we have other soldiers around us and we are armed with the Sword of the Spirit. (Ephesians
                6:17 &amp; Hebrews 4:12)One thing that the enemy will try to do is make you doubt your salvation. The
                last thing he needs is one more person confident in their relationship with Jesus Christ. As you read
                through these short devotions hold on to this truth: Salvation was yours the moment you acknowledged
                your need for a Savior (Romans 3:10-12), repented of your sins (Acts 3:19) and confessed Jesus Christ as
                your Lord. (Romans 10:9-10) Hopefully, you’ll find other truths to hang on to as you move through the
                pages of this book.So hold on to what you have (Revelation 3:11), hang tight with your “platoon”
                (Hebrews 10:24-25) and use the Sword (Hebrews 4:12 &amp; Ephesians 6:17) you’ll find in the following
                pages for your weapon as the words that accompany the Scripture give you encouragement to stay the
                course. ...more

                have a soul, Karen Hicks' The Coming Woman will make you fall in love with Victoria Woodhull."-Kinky
                Friedman, author and Governor of the Heart of Texas "What kind of confidence would it take for a woman
                to buck the old boy's club of politics in 1872? More than 140 years pre-Hillary, there was Victoria
                Woodhull. This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when
                women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind. I couldn't put
                it down."---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee"Sadly, too many
                Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary
                campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's
                rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal
                Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us
                that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting
                account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and
                eminently readable style."-Tim Wise, author, "White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged
                Son""The Coming Woman" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to
                run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's
                only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish
                a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association.
                She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's
                suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the
                14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria
                Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in
                love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing
                disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may
                shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually
                progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what
                Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious
                figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest,
                most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic
                story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the
                actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more

                with his first new novel since the New York Times bestseller Spook Country. Whatever you do, because you
                are an artist, will bring you to the next thing of your own... When she sang for The Curfew, Hollis
                Henry's face was known worldwide. She still runs into people who remember the poster. Unfortunately, in
                the post-crash economy, cult memorabilia doesn't pay the rent, and right now she's a journalist in need
                of a job. The last person she wants to work for is Hubertus Bigend, twisted genius of global marketing;
                but there's no way to tell an entity like Bigend that you want nothing more to do with him. That simply
                brings you more firmly to his attention. Milgrim is clean, drug-free for the first time in a decade. It
                took eight months in a clinic in Basel. Fifteen complete changes of his blood. Bigend paid for all that.
                Milgrim's idiomatic Russian is superb, and he notices things. Meanwhile no one notices Milgrim. That
                makes him worth every penny, though it cost Bigend more than his cartel-grade custom-armored truck. The
                culture of the military has trickled down to the street- Bigend knows that, and he'll find a way to take
                a cut. What surprises him though is that someone else seems to be on top of that situation in a way that
                Bigend associates only with himself. Bigend loves staring into the abyss of the global market; he's just
                not used to it staring back.Watch a Video ...more

                In is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering
                women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations
                about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major
                television show and on the cover of Time magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and
                leadership.Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a
                resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or
                equal pay, and some reticence creeps in.The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are
                certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20
                percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the
                Fortune 500 CEOs are women.In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most
                Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most
                successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in
                their life that can effect change on a more universal scale. ...more

                Raymond Berry NFL Hall of Fame Wide Receiver It’s well known that the NFL has been dominated through the
                years by quarterbacks sown and grown in a relatively small area surrounding the city of Pittsburgh in
                Western Pennsylvania. In America’s Cradle of Quarterbacks, author Wayne Stewart not only tells us who
                they are, he digs deep to explain the nature and nurture behind the rich harvest of signal callers
                (Montana, Unitas, Marino, Namath, Kelly, Blanda, etc.) who have risen from that fertile soil to claim
                Lombardi Trophies and dominate the gallery of busts in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Stewart has
                written a fascinating book that belongs on the shelves of football historians and everyday fans alike.

                symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious
                symbol—seared into the chest of a murdered physicist—he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the
                resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ... the most powerful underground
                organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its
                legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church. Langdon’s worst fears are confirmed
                on the eve of the holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an
                unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to

                400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair

                Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more
                desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately
                needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to
                throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him
                utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only
                result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest
                for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and
                Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too
                uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was
                found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their
                inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's
                abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through
                powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer
                networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at
                all if their brother Ender fails.~from author's web site ...more

            <description>The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the
                urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic
                years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that
                once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospit The Zombie War came
                unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the
                acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the
                United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards
                of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the
                testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the
                undead, hell of that dreadful time. "World War Z" is the result. Never before have we had access to a
                document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of
                resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. Ranging from the now infamous village
                of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the
                twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and
                temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided
                hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American
                tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the
                Zombie War. Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal
                event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on
                the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction,
                "By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may,
                heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true
                difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?" Note: Some of the numerical
                and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United
                Nations Postwar Commission. Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war&gt; ...more

                chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and,
                finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the

                many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a
                Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and
                actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one
                last thing about this, and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?”  Perhaps you want to know what Mindy
                thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night),
                or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts
                accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in
                a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages).
                If so, you’ve come to the right book, mostly! In Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy invites
                readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood,
                with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy
                Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States,
                but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka. ...more

                religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith
                in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally
                as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. From the bestselling author of
                "The Know-It-All" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a
                secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs
                decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year.
                He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to
                obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a
                ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound,
                reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book
                with new eyes.Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the
                entire "Encyclopedia Britannica" for "The Know-It-All." His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly
                mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert,
                battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.Throughout
                the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He
                tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with
                Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient
                biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the
                twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and
                challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, "The Year of Living Biblically"
                is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable. Thou shalt not be
                able to put it down. ...more

                story of first love, family, loss, and betrayal for fans of John Green, David Levithan, and Rainbow
                Rowell Jude and her twin brother, Noah, are incredibly close. At thirteen, isolated Noah draws
                constantly and is falling in love with the charismatic boy next door, while daredevil Jude cliff-dives
                and wears red-red lipstick and does the talking for both of them. But three years later, Jude and Noah
                are barely speaking. Something has happened to wreck the twins in different and dramatic ways . . .
                until Jude meets a cocky, broken, beautiful boy, as well as someone else—an even more unpredictable new
                force in her life. The early years are Noah's story to tell. The later years are Jude's. What the twins
                don't realize is that they each have only half the story, and if they could just find their way back to
                one another, they’d have a chance to remake their world. This radiant novel from the acclaimed,
                award-winning author of The Sky Is Everywhere will leave you breathless and teary and laughing—often all
                at once. ...more

                is forged between three men from very different backgrounds when they serve time together in prison. A
                series of wrong turns and disastrous life choices has led to their incarceration. Following their
                release, Mangle, Decker and Tazeem stick together as they return to a life of crime, embarking on a
                lucrative scam. But when they stumble upon a sophisticated sex-trafficking operation, they soon realise
                that they are in mortal danger. The disappearance of a family member and the murder of a dear friend
                lead the three to delve deeper into a world of violence and deception. In their quest for retribution
                and justice, they put their lives on the line. Their paths cross with that of Tatiana, who has left her
                home country for a better life in the West - or so she thinks. She soon realises she is in the hands of
                ruthless, violent people, who run an operation supplying girls to meet the most deviant desires of rich
                and powerful men. Will she survive the horrors of The Zombie Room? Are Mangle, Decker and Tazeem brave
                enough to follow her there, in an attempt to set her free? ...more

                definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things.

                nudge to help get the pencil moving and break that pesky block. By simplifying the human form, we hope
                to remove the inevitable anxiety that comes with drawing a person, and speed-up your art, over time,

                Abraham Lincoln have been analyzed and dissected in countless books. Do we need another Lincoln
                biography? In Team of Rivals, esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do. Though she
                can't help but cover some familiar territory, her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights
                into Lincoln's leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin
                makes the case for Lincoln's political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected
                for his cabinet, all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: William H. Seward,
                Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. These men, all accomplished, nationally known, and presidential,
                originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience, and were shocked and
                humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer. Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to
                join his administration--Seward as secretary of state, Chase as secretary of the treasury, and Bates as
                attorney general--he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well. How he soothed egos, turned
                rivals into allies, and dealt with many challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater
                good, is largely what Goodwin's fine book is about. Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to
                select and work with the best people, she argues, he could not have led the nation through one of its
                darkest periods. Ten years in the making, this engaging work reveals why "Lincoln's road to success was
                longer, more tortuous, and far less likely" than the other men, and why, when opportunity beckoned,
                Lincoln was "the best prepared to answer the call." This multiple biography further provides valuable
                background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward, Chase, and Bates. Lincoln may have
                been "the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War," but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and
                they played key roles in keeping the nation intact. --Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesn't just tell
                the story of Abraham Lincoln. It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political
                competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis. Here, Doris Kearns
                Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican
                presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln's cabinet.1. Edwin M.
                StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were
                involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of 1855. Unimaginable as it might seem after Stanton's
                demeaning behavior, Lincoln offered him "the most powerful civilian post within his gift"--the post of
                secretary of war--at their next encounter six years later. On his first day in office as Simon Cameron's
                replacement, the energetic, hardworking Stanton instituted "an entirely new regime" in the War
                Department. After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron, Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader
                the War Department desperately needed. Lincoln's choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to
                transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, or bitterness. As for Stanton, despite his initial contempt
                for the man he once described as a "long armed Ape," he not only accepted the offer but came to respect
                and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family. He was beside himself with grief
                for weeks after the president's death.2. Salmon P. ChaseChase, an Ohioan, had been both senator and
                governor, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party, and had shown an
                unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man. No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a
                natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself, but he refused to engage in the
                practical methods by which nominations are won. He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate
                his many enemies in Ohio itself. As a result, he alone among the candidates came to the convention
                without the united support of his own state. Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln, nor to resent
                the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior. His frustration with his
                position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he, rather than
                Lincoln, would be the Republican nominee in 1864, and he steadfastly worked to that end. The president
                put up with Chase's machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his
                superlative accomplishments at treasury. Eventually, however, Chase threatened to split the Republican
                Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes. When
                Lincoln stepped in, Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before, but this time Lincoln
                stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer.3. Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the
                Republican presidential nomination in 1860 he seemed to have come from nowhere--a backwoods lawyer who
                had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests
                for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance, to his moderate
                position on slavery, and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois. But
                Lincoln's triumph, particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals, owed much to a
                remarkable, unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship
                and defeat. That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate
                his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of an uncanny self-confidence
                and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.4. William H. Seward A
                celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before
                going to Washington, Seward was certain he was going to receive his party's nomination for president in
                1860. The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the
                valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate, assuming that he would resign his position as soon
                as the decision in Chicago was made. His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully
                abated, and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role
                in choosing the remaining cabinet members, conferring upon himself a position in the new government more
                commanding than that of Lincoln himself. He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the
                president to a figurehead role. Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues
                with Lincoln in the years ahead, exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do, Seward would become
                his closest friend, advisor, and ally in the administration. More than any other cabinet member Seward
                appreciated Lincoln's peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the
                country at large.5. Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman, a delegate to the convention that
                framed the Missouri Constitution, and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters
                were still widely sought, Bates's ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for
                his wife and large family, and he withdrew from public life in the late 1840s. For the next 20 years he
                was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined.
                However in early 1860, with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon
                him, he decided to try for the highest office in the land. After losing to Lincoln he vowed, in his
                diary, to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered, but with the country "in trouble and
                danger" he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general. Though Bates
                initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded that
                the president was an unmatched leader, "very near being a 'perfect man.'" ...more

                edition can be found here. Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is
                drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders—Lord
                Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of
                royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell,
                chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims
                through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood
                and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself
                King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming
                courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a
                disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of
                Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that
                is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and
                revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against
                brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight
                of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of
                the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the
                price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women
                possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels
                the tremors. Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty
                and boundless enchantment;a tale of pure excitement you will never forget. ...more

                bestselling author of the Sea Haven novels returns to the circle of the six sisters of the heart, bound
                by the elements—and to one who possesses the power to inflame the most dangerous passions of
                all. Flame-haired Lissa Piner is a skilled glass blower whose delicate gift conceals a burning inner
                strength that can destroy as exquisitely as it can create. Commissioned to design chandeliers for a
                string of luxury hotels, her remarkable skills have taken her to Italy. But Lissa’s real mission there
                is a secret. For her entire life has been a lie, leading to a chance to avenge a terrible wrong.  
                Enlisted as her bodyguard is Casmir Prakenskii, a trained assassin living off the grid. In Lissa, he
                sees a kindred spirit—something unexpected and wicked, mysterious and sensual. But more than desire is
                about to bring them together: because both of their pasts cry out for revenge. And for two people with
                this many secrets, this much passion, and this many enemies, someone is bound to get burned. ...more

                secrets, shocking lies and a dangerous obsession that will change one neighborhood forever.Liz McGinnis
                never imagined herself living in a luxurious gated community like The Palms. Ever since she and her
                family moved in, she's felt like an outsider amongst the Stepford-like wives and their obnoxiously
                spoiled children. Still, she's determined to make it work—if not for herself, then for her husband,
                Phil, who landed them this lavish home in the first place, and for her daughter, Danielle, who's about
                to enter high school. Yet underneath the glossy veneer of The Palms, life is far from idyllic. In a
                place where reputation is everything, Liz soon discovers that even the friendliest residents can't be
                trusted—and almost everyone has secrets they'd do anything to protect. So when the gorgeous girl next
                door befriends Danielle, Liz can't help but find sophisticated Kelsey's interest in her shy and slightly
                nerdy daughter a bit suspicious. But while Kelsey quickly becomes a fixture in the McGinnis home, Liz's
                relationships with both Danielle and Phil grow strained. Now even her own family seems to be hiding
                things, and it's not long before their dream of living the high life quickly spirals out of control…

                by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to
                work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are
                spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families
                are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city
                entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some
                of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, “Love don’t pay the bills.” She moves
                to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American
                cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of
                their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid,
                intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America
                today. As we see families forced  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we
                bear witness to the human cost of America’s vast inequality—and to people’s determination and
                intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered
                data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation
                while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable
                scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.

            <description>Andrea Harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending Duke Law School when
                her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father, Nicholas, and uncle, Michael, in a
                surprising and puzzling attack. They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother
                Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in I Andrea Harding is a
                recent college graduate looking forward to attending Duke Law School when her world is turned upside
                down by the shooting of her father, Nicholas, and uncle, Michael, in a surprising and puzzling attack.
                They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies
                from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who
                would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company.
                When her father’s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help
                Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new
                friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth’s own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea’s attorney after
                Andrea is violently attacked in her father’s home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be
                assassins. When Nicholas’s on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry
                Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own
                investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former
                colleague of Nicholas’s at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don’s wife Karen. Marshall
                has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea’s father. She also
                looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea’s closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason’s death
                from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties
                to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre
                Southington, daughter of Beth’s old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money
                than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage.
                A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via
                private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she
                has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out
                evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also
                cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with
                their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the
                governor’s seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a
                seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the
                Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the
                real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy
                international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can
                and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and
                advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could
                become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their
                right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come—the discovery that Viktor
                Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor’s seat in exchange for information about the Hardings,
                including Nicholas and Michael’s whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to
                forego law school and becomes her father’s new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many
                adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack
                of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end. ...more

                and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty
                personal about them."Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been
                synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his
                sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even
                today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. His constant wry observations about what he encounters,
                from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the
                eternal teenage experience of alienation. ...more

                #1 internationally best-selling author of The Alchemist.There is nothing wrong with anxiety.Although we
                cannot control God's time, it is part of the human condition to want to receive the thing we are waiting
                for as quickly as possible.Or to drive away whatever is causing our fear....Anxiety was born in the very
                same moment as mankind. And since we will never be able to master it, we will have to learn to live with
                it-just as we have learned to live with storms.* * *July 14, 1099. Jerusalem awaits the invasion of the
                crusaders who have surrounded the city's gates. There, inside the ancient city's walls, men and women of
                every age and every faith have gathered to hear the wise words of a mysterious man known only as the
                Copt. He has summoned the townspeople to address their fears with truth:"Tomorrow, harmony will become
                discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to war.... None of us can know what tomorrow
                will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget
                about the troops outside and the fear inside. Our task is not to leave a record of what happened on this
                date for those who will inherit the Earth; history will take care of that. Therefore, we will speak
                about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face."The people begin with questions about
                defeat, struggle, and the nature of their enemies; they contemplate the will to change and the virtues
                of loyalty and solitude; and they ultimately turn to questions of beauty, love, wisdom, sex, elegance,
                and what the future holds. "What is success?" poses the Copt. "It is being able to go to bed each night
                with your soul at peace."* * *Now, these many centuries later, the wise man's answers are a record of
                the human values that have endured throughout time. And, in Paulo Coelho's hands, The Manuscript Found
                in Accra reveals that who we are, what we fear, and what we hope for the future come from the knowledge
                and belief that can be found within us, and not from the adversity that surrounds us. ...more

                prior to her death in 1886; the startling originality of her work doomed it to obscurity in her

                vision, and the range of her intellectual and emotional explorations. Not until the 1955 publication of
                The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, a three-volume critical edition compiled by Thomas H. Johnson,
                were readers able for the first time to assess, understand, and appreciate the whole of Dickinson’s
                extraordinary poetic genius.This book, a distillation of the three-volume Complete Poems, brings

                whose influence is still felt today, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' The Communist Manifesto is edited
                with an introduction by Gareth Stedman-Jones in Penguin Classics.Marx and Engels's revolutionary summons
                to the working classes, The Communist Manifesto is one of the most important political theories ever
                formulated. After four years of collaboration, they produced an incisive account of their idea of
                Communism, in which they envisage a society without classes, private property or a state, arguing that
                the exploitation of industrial workers will eventually lead to a revolution in which Capitalism is
                overthrown. This vision provided the theoretical basis of political systems in Russia, China, Cuba and
                Eastern Europe, affecting the lives of millions. The Communist Manifesto still remains a landmark text:
                a work that continues to influence and provoke debate on capitalism and class.Gareth Stedman Jones's
                extensive and scholarly introduction provides an unique assessment of the place of The Communist
                Manifesto in history, and its continuing relevance as a depiction of global capitalism. This edition
                reproduces Samuel Moore's translation of 1888 and contains a guide to further reading, notes and an
                index.Karl Marx (1818-1883) was born in Trier, Germany and studied law at Bonn and Berlin. He settled in
                London, where he studied economics and wrote the first volume of his major work, Das Kapital (1867, with
                two further volumes in 1884 and 1894). He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London.Friedrich Engels
                (1820-1895), as well as his collaboration with Marx, was the author of The Condition of the Working

                religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in
                all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament to the more benign (but still
                illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major
                arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how
                religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and
                contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but
                potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual
                and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any
                faith could ever muster. ...more

                employee, his driver, who’s also his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddy. He lives alone in
                a small but extremely safe penthouse apartment, and his primary piece of furniture is a vintage pool
                table. He drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun.   Sebastian defends people other lawyers won’t
                go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult, who is accused of molesting and
                murdering two little girls; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a
                SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house.  Why these clients? Because he believes everyone is
                entitled to a fair trial, even if he, Sebastian, has to cheat to secure one. He hates injustice, doesn’t
                like insurance companies, banks, or big corporations; he distrusts all levels of government and laughs

            <description>As the Titanic and her passengers sank slowly into the Atlantic Ocean after striking an iceberg
                late in the evening of April 14, 1912, a nearby ship looked on. Second Officer Herbert Stone, in charge
                of the midnight watch on the SS Californian sitting idly a few miles north, saw the distress rockets

                passengers sank slowly into the Atlantic Ocean after striking an iceberg late in the evening of April
                14, 1912, a nearby ship looked on. Second Officer Herbert Stone, in charge of the midnight watch on the
                SS Californian sitting idly a few miles north, saw the distress rockets that the Titanic fired. He
                alerted the captain, Stanley Lord, who was sleeping in the chartroom below, but Lord did not come to the
                bridge. Eight rockets were fired during the dark hours of the midnight watch, and eight rockets were
                ignored. The next morning, the Titanic was at the bottom of the sea and more than 1,500 people were
                dead. When they learned of the extent of the tragedy, Lord and Stone did everything they could to hide
                their role in the disaster, but pursued by newspapermen, lawyers, and political leaders in America and
                England, their terrible secret was eventually revealed. The Midnight Watch is a fictional telling of
                what may have occurred that night on the SS Californian, and the resulting desperation of Officer Stone
                and Captain Lord in the aftermath of their inaction.Told not only from the perspective of the SS
                Californian crew, but also through the eyes of a family of third-class passengers who perished in the
                disaster, the narrative is drawn together by Steadman, a tenacious Boston journalist who does not rest
                until the truth is found. The Midnight Watch is a powerful and dramatic debut novel--the result of many
                years of research in Liverpool, London, New York, and Boston, and informed by the author's own
                experiences as a ship's officer and a lawyer. ...more

                thirteen works of art today worth over $500 million were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
                in Boston. It remains the largest unsolved art heist in history, and Claire Roth, a struggling young
                artist, is about to discover that there’s more to this crime than meets the eye.Making a living
                reproducing famous artworks for a popular online retailer and desperate to improve her situation, Claire
                is lured into a Faustian bargain with Aiden Markel, a powerful gallery owner. She agrees to forge a
                painting—a Degas masterpiece stolen from the Gardner Museum—in exchange for a one-woman show in his
                renowned gallery. But when that very same long-missing Degas painting is delivered to Claire’s studio,
                she begins to suspect that it may itself be a forgery.Her desperate search for the truth leads Claire
                into a labyrinth of deceit where secrets hidden since the late nineteenth century may be the only
                evidence that can now save her life. ...more

            <description>Since it was first published in 1954, William Golding's classic debut novel has remained a
                stark allegory of civilization, survival, and human nature. As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and
                Battle Royale surge in popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert

                published in 1954, William Golding's classic debut novel has remained a stark allegory of civilization,
                survival, and human nature. As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and Battle Royale surge in
                popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates
                schoolchildren around the world, raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can
                slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned.When a plane crashes on a remote
                island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph
                to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality-
                and brutal savagery-of their situation sets in.A teacher himself, Golding clearly understood how to
                interest children with a gripping story and strong, sympathetic characters. The novel serves as a
                catalyst for thought-provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues, not only concerning the
                capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition, but beyond.The boys'
                struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate
                the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Symbolism is strong
                throughout, revealing both the boys' capacity for empathy and hope, as well as illuminating the darkest
                corners of the human spirit. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into
                question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the
                acquisition of power may be.Often compared to Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies also represents a
                coming-of-age story of innocence lost. ...more

                through a crack in the ceiling. Ever since his sister had a baby, everyone’s been acting very strangely.
                The boy begins to wonder why they never say who the father is, about what happened before his own birth,
                about why they’re shut away.A few days ago, some fireflies arrived in the basement. His grandma said,
                There’s no creature more amazing than one that can make its own light. That light makes the boy want to

                Judean desert, Masada. According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children

                hundred Jews held out for months against armies of Romans on a mountain in the Judean desert, Masada.
                According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Four bold,
                resourceful, and sensuous women come to Masada by a different path. Yael’s mother died in childbirth,
                and her father never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker’s wife, watched the horrifically
                brutal murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her twin grandsons, rendered mute
                by their own witness. Aziza is a warrior’s daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and expert
                marksman, who finds passion with another soldier. Shirah is wise in the ways of ancient magic and
                medicine, a woman with uncanny insight and power. The four lives intersect in the desperate days of the
                siege, as the Romans draw near. All are dovekeepers, and all are also keeping secrets — about who they
                are, where they come from, who fathered them, and whom they love. ...more

                from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any
                point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options
                are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why
                did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed
                Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude
                named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be
                sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a
                short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades
                ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and,
                after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by
                the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a
                quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight
                at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another
                level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project,
                including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to
                Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on
                Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including
                Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb
                Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.In Modern Romance,
                Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour
                of our new romantic world. ...more

            <description>Since its original publication, Joy of Cooking has been the most authoritative cookbook in
                America, the one upon which millions of cooks have confidently relied for more than sixty-five years.
                It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister
                when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is be Since its original
                publication, Joy of Cooking has been the most authoritative cookbook in America, the one upon which
                millions of cooks have confidently relied for more than sixty-five years. It's the book your grandmother
                and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the
                first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been
                rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.All the recipes have been reconceived
                and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to
                the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new
                Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the
                book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where
                you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.The new Joy
                provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance,
                almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available,
                how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features
                a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and
                how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new "RULES" section in many chapters gives
                essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching
                sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect
                souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains,
                beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean
                casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's
                reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and
                sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts,
                cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include
                one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different
                kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the
                stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception
                without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta,
                tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment,
                integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this
                book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens
                of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart
                now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for
                substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.From cover to
                cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and
                cooking teachers. An invaluable combination of old and new, this edition of Joy of Cooking promises to
                keep you cooking for years to come. ...more

                of moral endurance, Homer's ancient Greek epic The Odyssey is translated by Robert Fagles with an
                introduction and notes by Bernard Knox in Penguin Classics.When Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad
                was published in 1990, critics and scholars alike hailed it as a masterpiece. Here, one of the great
                modern translators presents us with The Odyssey, Homer's best-loved poem, recounting Odysseus'
                wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the 'man of twists and turns' meets the challenges
                of the sea-god Poseidon, and monsters ranging from the many-headed Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops
                Polyphemus - only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelope's suitors. In the
                myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer's original in a
                bold, contemporary idiom.Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c.
                8th-7th century BC), the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad
                is the oldest surviving work of Western literature, but the identity - or even the existence - of Homer
                himself is a complete mystery, with no reliable biographical information having survived.If you enjoyed
                The Odyssey, you might like Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad, also available in Penguin

                visible evidence. The bursting of the housing bubble in 2008, the devastating aftermath of Hurricane
                Katrina and other natural disasters, the new digital technologies that upended the media world, the fall
                of the Soviet Union...all were evident well in advance.Why do leaders and decision makers keep failing
                to address obvious dangers before they spiral out of control? Drawing on her extensive background in

                to the Twentieth Century is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music, which remains an obscure world
                for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or
                more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the
                land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same
                time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate
                the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music
                from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt
                compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest
                noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical
                past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether
                they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always
                been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative
                goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's
                Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass
                politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and
                friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a
                history of the twentieth century through its music. ...more

                triumphant, blood-spattered return to the genre that made him famous. Cell, the king of horror's homage
                to zombie films (the book is dedicated in part to George A. Romero) is his goriest, most horrific novel
                in years, not to mention the most intensely paced. Casting aside his love of elaborate character and
                town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the
                first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very
                last page. In Cell King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones
                deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity,
                leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator
                Clayton Riddell and his small band of "normies," must fight for survival, and their journey to find
                Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. Fans that have followed King
                from the beginning will recognize and appreciate Cell as a departure--King's writing has not been so
                pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal Dark Tower series and receiving
                a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either). "Retirement" clearly suits King, and
                lucky for us, having nothing left to prove frees him up to write frenzied, juiced-up horror-thrillers
                like Cell. Stay tuned for more from the hardest-working retiree in the business with Lisey's Story,
                coming in October 2006. --Daphne Durham ...more

                Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science and philosophy, and
                speculates to the future of science. The book also discusses the underlying premises of science by
                providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history, placing their
                contributions into the broader context of the development of modern science.The book covers a broad
                range of topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological,
                historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position
                on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien
                civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth.

            <description>The Iliad is one of the two great epics of Homer, and is typically described as one of the
                greatest war stories of all time, but to say the Iliad is a war story does not begin to describe the
                emotional sweep of its action and characters: Achilles, Helen, Hector, and other heroes of Greek myth
                and history in the tenth and final year of the Greek siege of Troy.

                Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the
                nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus' own emotions. But while the
                Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs
                Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of
                extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and

            <description>This entirely new translation of Critique of Pure Reason is the most accurate and informative
                English translation ever produced of this epochal philosophical text. Though its simple, direct style
                will make it suitable for all new readers of Kant, the translation displays a philosophical and textual
                sophistication that will enlighten Kant scholars as well. This translation This entirely new translation

                this epochal philosophical text. Though its simple, direct style will make it suitable for all new
                readers of Kant, the translation displays a philosophical and textual sophistication that will enlighten
                Kant scholars as well. This translation recreates as far as possible a text with the same interpretative
                nuances and richness as the original.This translation of Kant's Critique is a superb volume that forms
                the heart of Cambridge's excellent series of translations of Kant's works. Because of the quality of the
                translation, but also because of the various supplementary materials which it provides...it will very
                likely replace Norman Kemp Smith's translation as the standard edition for scholars. It is difficult to
                imagine that anyone would be able to improve on this volume in the foreseeable future. ...more

            <description>A life shared with pets brings many emotions. We feel love for our companions, certainly, and
                happiness at the thought that we’re providing them with a safe, healthy life. But there’s another
                emotion, less often acknowledged, that can be nearly as powerful: guilt. When we see our cats gazing

                pets brings many emotions. We feel love for our companions, certainly, and happiness at the thought that
                we’re providing them with a safe, healthy life. But there’s another emotion, less often acknowledged,
                that can be nearly as powerful: guilt. When we see our cats gazing wistfully out the window, or watch a
                goldfish swim lazy circles in a bowl, we can’t help but wonder: are we doing the right thing, keeping
                these independent beings locked up, subject to our control? Is keeping pets actually good for the pets
                themselves?   That’s the question that animates Jessica Pierce’s powerful Run, Spot, Run. A lover of
                pets herself (including, over the years, dogs, cats, fish, rats, hermit crabs, and more), Pierce
                understands the joys that pets bring us. But she also refuses to deny the ambiguous ethics at the heart
                of the relationship, and through a mix of personal stories, philosophical reflections, and
                scientifically informed analyses of animal behavior and natural history, she puts pet-keeping to the
                test. Is it ethical to keep pets at all? Are some species more suited to the relationship than others?
                Are there species one should never attempt to own? And are there ways that we can improve our pets’
                lives, so that we can be confident that we are giving them as much as they give us?   Deeply empathetic,
                yet rigorous and unflinching in her thinking, Pierce has written a book that is sure to help any pet
                owner, unsettling assumptions but also giving them the knowledge to build deeper, better relationships
                with the animals with whom they’ve chosen to share their lives. ...more

                invited to the Toneybee Institute in rural Massachusetts to participate in a research experiment. They
                will live in an apartment on campus with Charlie, a young chimp abandoned by his mother. The Freemans
                were selected for the experiment because they know sign language; they are supposed to teach it to
                Charlie and welcome him as a member of their family. Isolated in their new, nearly all-white community
                not just by their race but by their strange living situation, the Freemans come undone. And when
                Charlotte discovers the truth about the Institute’s history of questionable studies, the secrets of the
                past begin to invade the present. The power of this novel resides in Kaitlyn Greenidge’s undeniable
                storytelling talents. What appears to be a story of mothers and daughters, of sisterhood put to the
                test, of adolescent love and grown-up misconduct, and of history’s long reach, becomes a provocative and
                compelling exploration of America’s failure to find a language to talk about race. ...more

                can never be recovered. Now, out on parole, Allie is determined to clear her name, rebuild her life, and
                reconnect with the daughter she barely knows.But Allie’s return home shatters the quaint, coastal
                community of Brunswick, Georgia. Even her own daughter Caroline, now a teenager, bristles at Allie’s
                claims of innocence. Refusing defeat, a stronger, smarter Allie launches a battle for the truth, digging
                deeply into the past even if it threatens her parole status, personal safety, and the already-fragile
                bond with family.As her commitment to finding the truth intensifies, what Allie ultimately uncovers is
                far worse than she imagined. Her own sister has been hiding a dark secret—one that holds the key to
                Allie’s freedom. ...more

                once-in-a-generation palate who becomes the iconic chef behind the country’s most coveted dinner
                reservation, is the summer’s most hotly anticipated debut.   When Lars Thorvald’s wife, Cynthia, falls
                in love with wine—and a dashing sommelier—he’s left to raise their baby, Eva, on his own. He’s
                determined to pass on his love of food to his daughter—starting with puréed pork shoulder. As Eva grows,

                feast that’s a testament to her spirit and resilience.   Each chapter in J. Ryan Stradal’s startlingly
                original debut tells the story of a single dish and character, at once capturing the zeitgeist of the
                Midwest, the rise of foodie culture, and delving into the ways food creates community and a sense of
                identity. By turns quirky, hilarious, and vividly sensory, Kitchens of the Great Midwest is an
                unexpected mother-daughter story about the bittersweet nature of life—its missed opportunities and its
                joyful surprises. It marks the entry of a brilliant new talent.From the Hardcover edition. ...more

                novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far—a book about the power of
                storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in Mr. Mercedes“Wake
                up, genius.” So begins King’s instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John
                Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book
                for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but
                because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein
                and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one
                more Gold novel.Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime.
                Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill
                Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris
                when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years.Not since Misery has King played with the notion
                of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding
                suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life—for good, for bad, forever.

                breaking her parents’ hearts. To make matters worse, Cassie had always been their father’s favorite -- a
                sentiment that weighed heavily on her sisters and made Cassie’s actions even harder to bear.Now
                thirty-one, Cassie is back in Washington, living in Seattle with her daughter and hoping to leave her
                past behind. After ending a difficult marriage, Cassie is back on her own two feet, the pieces of her

                peace with her sisters. Karen, the oldest, is a busy wife and mother, balancing her career with raising
                her two children. And Nichole, the youngest, is a stay-at-home mom whose husband indulges her every
                whim. Then one day, Cassie receives a letter from Karen, offering what Cassie thinks may be a chance to
                reconcile. And as Cassie opens herself up to new possibilities -- making amends with her sisters,
                finding love once more -- she realizes the power of compassion, and the promise of a fresh start.

                Something is very wrong.When he arrives home, the power is out and there is no running water. The pipes
                everywhere, it seems, have gone dry. Eddie and his wife, Laura, find themselves thrust together with

                Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre
                has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French
                cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of
                clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously
                disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a
                secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a
                breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while
                avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost

            <description>On a languid midsummer’s day in the countryside, old Adam Godley, a renowned theoretical
                mathematician, is dying. His family gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain
                his marriage to a radiantly beautiful actress; his nineteen-year-old daughter, Petra, filled with voices
                and visions as she waits for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose rela On a languid midsummer’s
                day in the countryside, old Adam Godley, a renowned theoretical mathematician, is dying. His family
                gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain his marriage to a radiantly
                beautiful actress; his nineteen-year-old daughter, Petra, filled with voices and visions as she waits
                for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose relations with the Godley children are strained at best;
                and Petra’s “young man”—very likely more interested in the father than the daughter—who has arrived for
                a superbly ill-timed visit.But the Godley family is not alone in their vigil. Around them hovers a
                family of mischievous immortals—among them, Zeus, who has his eye on young Adam’s wife; Pan, who has
                taken the doughy, perspiring form of an old unwelcome acquaintance; and Hermes, who is the genial and
                omniscient narrator: “We too are petty and vindictive,” he tells us, “just like you, when we are put to
                it.” As old Adam’s days on earth run down, these unearthly beings start to stir up trouble, to sometimes
                wildly unintended effect. . . . Blissfully inventive and playful, rich in psychological insight and
                sensual detail, The Infinities is at once a gloriously earthy romp and a wise look at the terrible,
                wonderful plight of being human—a dazzling novel from one of the most widely admired and acclaimed
                writers at work today. ...more

                ambition, success, and secrecy in 1950s New York.   In 1958, Greenwich Village buzzes with beatniks,
                jazz clubs, and new ideas—the ideal spot for three ambitious young people to meet. Cliff Nelson, the son
                of a successful book editor, is convinced he’s the next Kerouac, if only his father would notice. Eden
                Katz dreams of being an editor but is shocked when she encounters roadblocks to that ambition. And Miles
                Tillman, a talented black writer from Harlem, seeks to learn the truth about his father’s past, finding
                love in the process. Though different from one another, all three share a common goal: to succeed in the
                competitive and uncompromising world of book publishing. As they reach for what they want, they come to
                understand what they must sacrifice, conceal, and betray to achieve their goals, learning they must live
                with the consequences of their choices. In Three-Martini Lunch, Suzanne Rindell has written both a
                page-turning morality tale and a captivating look at a stylish, demanding era—and a world steeped in
                tradition that’s poised for great upheaval. ...more

                Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings
                about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping
                opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash
                between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel
                about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich. ...more

                who we want to be.In war we find out who we are.FRANCE, 1939In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne
                Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn’t believe that the
                Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and
                tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When France is overrun, Vianne is
                forced to take an enemy into her house, and suddenly her every move is watched; her life and her child’s
                life is at constant risk. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates around her, she must make
                one terrible choice after another. Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl,
                searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into
                the unknown terrors of war, she meets the compelling and mysterious Gäetan, a partisan who believes the
                French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely.
                When he betrays her, Isabelle races headlong into danger and joins the Resistance, never looking back or
                giving a thought to the real--and deadly--consequences.With courage, grace and powerful insight,
                bestselling author Kristin Hannah takes her talented pen to the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an
                intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters,
                separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own
                dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly
                beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a
                novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime. ...more

                winner Elizabeth Strout is cause for celebration. Her bestselling novels, including Olive Kitteridge and
                The Burgess Boys, have illuminated our most tender relationships. Now, in My Name Is Lucy Barton, this
                extraordinary writer shows how a simple hospital visit becomes a portal to the most tender relationship
                of all—the one between mother and daughter.   Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have
                been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn’t spoken for many years, comes to see her. Gentle
                gossip about people from Lucy’s childhood in Amgash, Illinois, seems to reconnect them, but just below
                the surface lie the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of Lucy’s life: her escape from
                her troubled family, her desire to become a writer, her marriage, her love for her two daughters.
                Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly
                observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable. ...more

                insights that are hallmarks of Anna Quindlen’s bestsellers, this extraordinary novel is about a woman
                coming of age, as she unearths secrets about her family and her town, and surprising truths about
                herself.For generations the Millers have lived in Miller’s Valley. Mimi Miller tells about her life with
                intimacy and honesty. As Mimi eavesdrops on her parents and quietly observes the people around her, she
                discovers more and more about the toxicity of family secrets, the dangers of gossip, the flaws of
                marriage, the inequalities of friendship and the risks of passion, loyalty, and love. Home, as Mimi
                begins to realize, can be “a place where it’s just as easy to feel lost as it is to feel content.”
                Miller’s Valley is a masterly study of family, memory, loss, and, ultimately, discovery, of finding true
                identity and a new vision of home. As Mimi says, “No one ever leaves the town where they grew up, even
                if they go.” Miller’s Valley reminds us that the place where you grew up can disappear, and the people
                in it too, but all will live on in your heart forever. ...more

            <description>Provocative, haunting, and indelible, Colm Tóibín’s portrait of Mary presents her as a solitary
                older woman still seeking to understand the events that become the narrative of the New Testament and
                the foundation of Christianity.In the ancient town of Ephesus, Mary lives alone, years after her son's

                Christianity.In the ancient town of Ephesus, Mary lives alone, years after her son's crucifixion. She
                has no interest in collaborating with the authors of the Gospel—her keepers, who provide her with food
                and shelter and visit her regularly. She does not agree that her son is the Son of God; nor that his
                death was “worth it;” nor that the “group of misfits he gathered around him, men who could not look a
                woman in the eye,” were holy disciples. Mary judges herself ruthlessly (she did not stay at the foot of
                the Cross until her son died—she fled, to save herself), and is equally harsh on her judgment of others.
                This woman who we know from centuries of paintings and scripture as the docile, loving, silent,
                long-suffering, obedient, worshipful mother of Christ becomes, in Toibin’s searing evocation, a tragic
                heroine with the relentless eloquence of Electra or Medea or Antigone. This tour de force of imagination
                and language is a portrait so vivid and convincing that our image of Mary will be forever transformed.

                and--martyred, heroic--is now in his third term. Twenty-two-year-old Eugene Allen returns home from his
                tour of duty in Vietnam and begins to write a war novel--a book echoing Catch-22 and
                Slaughterhouse-Five--about veterans who have their battlefield experiences "enfolded," wiped fro By the
                early 1970s, President John F. Kennedy has survived several assassination attempts and--martyred,
                heroic--is now in his third term. Twenty-two-year-old Eugene Allen returns home from his tour of duty in
                Vietnam and begins to write a war novel--a book echoing Catch-22 and Slaughterhouse-Five--about veterans
                who have their battlefield experiences "enfolded," wiped from their memories through drugs and therapy.
                In Eugene's fictive universe, veterans too damaged to be enfolded stalk the American heartland,
                reenacting atrocities on civilians and evading the Psych Corps, a federal agency dedicated to upholding
                the mental hygiene of the nation by any means necessary.This alternative America, in which a veteran
                tries to reimagine a damaged world, is the subject of Hystopia, the long-awaited first novel by David
                Means. The critic James Wood has written that Means's language "offers an exquisitely precise and
                sensuous register of an often crazy American reality." Means brings this talent to bear on the national
                trauma of the Vietnam era in a work that is outlandish, ruefully funny, and shockingly violent. Written
                in conversation with some of the greatest war narratives from the Iliad to the Rolling Stones' "Gimme
                Shelter," Hystopia is a unique and visionary novel. ...more

                beguiling second novel from Alain de Botton that tracks the beautifully complicated arc of a romantic
                partnership, from the internationally bestselling author of On Love and How Proust Can Change Your
                Life.We all know the headiness and excitement of the early days of love. But what comes after? In
                Edinburgh, a couple, Rabih and Kirsten, fall in love. They get married, they have children—but no
                long-term relationship is as simple as “happily ever after.” The Course of Love is a novel that explores
                what happens after the birth of love, what it takes to maintain love, and what happens to our original
                ideals under the pressures of an average existence. You experience, along with Rabih and Kirsten, the
                first flush of infatuation, the effortlessness of falling into romantic love, and the course of life
                thereafter. Interwoven with their story and its challenges is an overlay of philosophy—an annotation and
                a guide to what we are reading.This is a Romantic novel in the true sense, one interested in exploring
                how love can survive and thrive in the long term. The result is a sensory experience—fictional,
                philosophical, psychological—that urges us to identify deeply with these characters, and to reflect on
                his and her own experiences in love. Fresh, visceral, and utterly compelling, The Course of Love is a
                provocative and life-affirming novel for everyone who believes in love. ...more

                stumble into the extraordinary, as it does for Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in Lisbon
                Falls, Maine. While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned
                by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of
                his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s
                friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his
                obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s
                storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke...
                Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a
                troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become
                heart-stoppingly suspenseful. ...more

                of darkness in the foster care system by hiding behind her favorite characters in literature, even

                Samantha receives an extraordinary opportunity. The anonymous “Mr. Knightley” offers her a full
                scholarship to earn her graduate degree at the prestigious Medill School of Journalism. The sole

                the well-known fashion writer and editor, an unforgettable novel about a woman with a secret who travels
                to New York City on a determined quest to buy a special dress that represents everything she wants to
                say about that secret…and herself.Sometimes a dress isn’t just a dress.Emilia Brown is a woman of a
                certain age. She has spent a frugal, useful, and wholly restrained life in Ashville, a small town in
                Rhode Island. Overlooked especially by the industries of fashion and media, Mrs. Brown is one of today’s
                silent generations of women whose quiet no-frills existences would make them seem invisible. She is a
                genteel woman who has known her share of personal sorrows and quietly carried on, who makes a modest
                living cleaning and running errands at the local beauty parlor, who delights in evening chats with her
                much younger neighbor, twenty-three-year-old Alice Danvers.When the grand dame of Ashville passes away,
                Mrs. Brown is called upon to inventory her estate and comes across a dress that changes everything. This
                isn’t a Cinderella confection; it’s a simple yet exquisitely tailored Oscar de la Renta sheath and
                jacket—a suit that Mrs. Brown realizes, with startling clarity, will say everything she has ever wished
                to convey. She must have it. And so Mrs. Brown begins her odyssey to purchase the dress. For not only is
                the owning of the Oscar de la Renta a must, the intimidating trip to purchase it on Madison Avenue is
                essential as well. If the dress is to give Mrs. Brown a voice, then she must prepare by making the
                daunting journey—both to the emerald city and within herself.Timeless, poignant, and appealing, My Mrs.
                Brown is a novel for every mother in the world, every woman who ever wanted the perfect dress, and every
                child who wanted to give it to her. ...more

                Mallorca with their extended family and friends is a celebration: Franny and Jim are observing their
                thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, and their daughter, Sylvia, has graduated from high school. The sunlit
                island, its mountains and beaches, its tapas and tennis courts, also promise an escape from the tensions
                simmering at home in Manhattan. But all does not go according to plan: over the course of the vacation,
                secrets come to light, old and new humiliations are experienced, childhood rivalries resurface, and
                ancient wounds are exacerbated. This is a story of the sides of ourselves that we choose to show and
                those we try to conceal, of the ways we tear each other down and build each other up again, and the
                bonds that ultimately hold us together. With wry humor and tremendous heart, Emma Straub delivers a

            <description>In the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's The End of
                Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion. With a close and erudite reading
                of the major religious texts, he documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of
                dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. Hit In the tradition of

                science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe and
                Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix. ...more

                troubling, and moving exploration of the brutal murder of a possibly transgender middle school student
                by an eighth grade classmateOn Feb. 12, 2008, at E. O. Green Junior High in Oxnard, CA, 14-year-old
                Brandon McInerney shot and killed his classmate, Larry King, who had recently begun to call himself
                "Leticia" and wear makeup and jewelry to school.Profoundly shaken by the news, and unsettled by media
                coverage that sidestepped the issues of gender identity and of race integral to the case, psychologist
                Ken Corbett traveled to LA to attend the trial. As visions of victim and perpetrator were woven and
                unwoven in the theater of the courtroom, a haunting picture emerged not only of the two young teenagers,
                but also of spectators altered by an atrocity and of a community that had unwittingly gestated a murder.
                Drawing on firsthand observations, extensive interviews and research, as well as on his decades of
                academic work on gender and sexuality, Corbett holds each murky facet of this case up to the light,
                exploring the fault lines of memory and the lacunae of uncertainty behind facts. Deeply compassionate,
                and brimming with wit and acute insight, A Murder Over a Girl is a riveting and stranger-than-fiction
                drama of the human psyche. ...more

                shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it’s falling in

                place in Hollywood when you’re constantly reminded that no one looks like you.In “How to Look
                Spectacular: A Starlet’s Confessions,” Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera
                beauty, (“Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn’t the land of
                appropriate–this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman’s traditional hair color is honey
                blonde.”) “Player” tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (“I had
                been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.”) In “Unlikely Leading Lady,” she
                muses on America’s fixation with the weight of actresses, (“Most women we see onscreen are either so

                And in “Soup Snakes,” Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close
                friend, B.J. Novak (“I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.”)Mindy turns
                the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny
                collection of essays that anyone who’s ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate
                to. And those who’ve never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting
                Bradley Cooper. ...more

            <description>John Grisham says THE TUMOR is the most important book he has ever written. In this short book,
                he provides readers with a fictional account of how a real, new medical technology could revolutionize
                the future of medicine by curing with sound. THE TUMOR follows the present day experience of the

                TUMOR is the most important book he has ever written. In this short book, he provides readers with a
                fictional account of how a real, new medical technology could revolutionize the future of medicine by
                curing with sound. THE TUMOR follows the present day experience of the fictional patient Paul, an
                otherwise healthy 35-year-old father who is diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Grisham takes
                readers through a detailed account of Paul’s treatment and his family’s experience that doesn’t end as
                we would hope. Grisham then explores an alternate future, where Paul is diagnosed with the same brain
                tumor at the same age, but in the year 2025, when a treatment called focused ultrasound is able to
                extend his life expectancy. Focused ultrasound has the potential to treat not just brain tumors, but
                many other disorders, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, hypertension, and prostate, breast and
                pancreatic cancer. For more information, you can visit The Focused Ultrasound Foundation’s website. Here
                you will find a video of Grisham on the TEDx stage with the Foundation’s chairman and a Parkinson’s
                patient who brings the audience to its feet sharing her incredible story of a focused ultrasound
                “miracle.” Readers will get a taste of the narrative they expect from Grisham, but this short book will
                also educate and inspire people to be hopeful about the future of medical innovation. ...more

                writers, in a deluxe centennial edition In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across
                America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass
                and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure An intimate journey
                across and in search of America, as told by one of its most beloved writers, in a deluxe centennial
                edition In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might
                have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and
                quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of
                the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a
                three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante.   His course took him through almost forty states:
                northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North
                Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his
                birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas,
                to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama,
                Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York.  Travels with Charley in Search of America is an
                intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of
                a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in
                the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on
                the eve of a tumultuous decade.  ...more

                BESTSELLER "Wildly entertaining ... Lyons has injected a dose of sanity into a world gone mad."
                ---Ashlee Vance, New York Times-bestselling author of Elon MuskFor twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a
                magazine writer at the top of his profession--until one Friday morning when he received a phone call:
                Poof. His job no longer existed. "I think they just want to hire younger people," his boss at Newsweek
                told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea
                hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston
                start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for
                the vague role of "marketing fellow." What could go wrong? HubSpotters were true believers: They were
                making the world a better place ... by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult
                compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; "shower pods" became
                hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the "content factory," Nerf gun
                fights raged. Groups went on "walking meetings," and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about
                employees who had "graduated" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the
                age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his
                co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball "chair."Mixed in with Lyons's uproarious tale of his
                rise and fall at Hubspot is a trenchant analysis of the start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between
                those who start companies and those who fund them, a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty
                investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where
                everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to reach an IPO and cash out. With a cast of characters
                that includes devilish angel investors, fad-chasing venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and
                "wantrapreneurs," bloggers and brogrammers, social climbers and sociopaths, Disrupted is a gripping and

                Annie F. Downs shares personal stories, biblical truth, and examples of how others have courageously
                walked the path God paved for their lives by remembering all God had done, loving what was right in

                conversations and life changing patterns. No matter who we are and what path God has us on, we all need
                to look for lovely, fight to finish, and find beautiful in our every day! ...more

                on consumerism. … [A] thoughtful and unhurried investigation into consumerism that pushes the analysis
                to the maximum…” — Publisher’s Weekly (starred review) Brands are dead. Advertising no longer works.
                Weaned on TiVo, the Internet, and other emerging technologies, the short-attention-span generation has
                become immune to marketing. Consumers are “in control.” Or so we’re told.In Buying In, New York Times
                Magazine “Consumed” columnist Rob Walker argues that this accepted wisdom misses a much more important
                and lasting cultural shift. As technology has created avenues for advertising anywhere and everywhere,
                people are embracing brands more than ever before–creating brands of their own and participating in
                marketing campaigns for their favorite brands in unprecedented ways. Increasingly, motivated consumers
                are pitching in to spread the gospel virally, whether by creating Internet video ads for Converse All
                Stars or becoming word-of-mouth “agents” touting products to friends and family on behalf of huge
                corporations. In the process, they–we–have begun to funnel cultural, political, and community activities
                through connections with brands. Walker explores this changing cultural landscape–including a practice
                he calls “murketing,” blending the terms murky and marketing–by introducing us to the creative
                marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it.
                Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red
                Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as
                consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of
                cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buy–and vice versa.
                Praise for Buying In “Walker … makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many
                people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. … [He]
                leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers
                actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. … Convincing.” — Jay Dixit, The Washington Post
                “Walker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.” — Seth Stevenson, Slate “Buying In
                delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we aren’t too pretty.
                Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking
                ranges to custom high-tops.” — Robert Blinn, Core77 “Rob Walker is one smart shopper.” — Jen Trolio,
                ReadyMade “The most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and
                fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.” –Michael Pollan,
                author of In Defense of Food “This book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing
                and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the
                innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt
                the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this
                is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.”–Po Bronson,
                author of What Should I Do with My Life? “Rob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered,
                scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions ‘What
                am I about?’ and ‘How do I connect?’ His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive
                and more hidden–that we are not so self-defined as we like to think–should make us disturbed, and
                vigilant.”–Jim Collins, author of Good to Great“Rob Walker is a terrific writer who understands both
                human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but it’s also a deeply thoughtful
                look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.”–Bethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune,
                and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the Room“Are we living in an era of YouTube-empowered,
                brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you won’t want to miss this
                joyride through the front lines of consumer culture. A marketing must-read.”–Chip Heath and Dan Heath,
                authors of Made to Stick “Rob Walker brilliantly deconstructs the religion of consumption. Love his
                column, couldn’t put his book down.”–Paco Underhill, author of Why We Buy ...more

            <description>What should we have for dinner?" To one degree or another this simple question assails any
                creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma.
                Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe,
                and what isn't—which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries What should we have for
                dinner?" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of
                things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless
                potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't—which mushrooms
                should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can
                only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic
                vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on
                a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels
                might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications
                for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's
                brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating
                in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains
                that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or "organic" food, and food people obtain by dint of
                their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up
                to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He
                concludes each section by sitting down to a meal—at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner
                from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary "beyond organic" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the
                provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining
                how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed
                what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused
                omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food
                choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and
                one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet
                momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore's Dilemma:Of the 38
                ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different
                menu items at Mcdonald’s are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every
                day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth
                of all the petroleum consumed in the United States—more than we burn with our cars and more than any
                other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food
                energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry
                from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial
                fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II
                munitions industry to civilian uses—nerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives
                became nitrogen fertilizers. ... ...more

                like us, people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly or made a mistake at work.
                Once the transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the
                next thing they know, they're being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even
                fired from their job.A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been
                democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice, but what are we doing with our voice? We are
                mercilessly finding people's faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of
                those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.Simultaneously powerful and hilarious
                in the way only Jon Ronson can be, So You've Been Publicly Shamed is a deeply honest book about modern
                life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws and the very scary part we all
                play in it. ...more

                frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One , legendary entrepreneur and investor
                Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the
                contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by
                shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why
                progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or
                area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to
                think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding
                more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will
                not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s
                champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition
                altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of
                the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to
                ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places. ...more

                reporter Joby Warrick reveals how the strain of militant Islam now raising its banner across Iraq and
                Syria spread from a remote Jordanian prison with the unwitting aid of American military
                intervention.     When he succeeded his father in 1999, King Abdullah of Jordan released a batch of
                political prisoners in the hopes of smoothing his transition to power. Little did he know that among
                those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too
                dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle
                East.     Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern
                Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast
                insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a
                monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his
                cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian
                intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006
                airstrike.     But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of
                Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as
                the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping,
                ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.      Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby
                Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical
                perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.From the

                HAPPENED, Jenny Lawson baffled readers with stories about growing up the daughter of a taxidermist. In
                her new book, FURIOUSLY HAPPY, Jenny explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical,
                ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. And terrible
                ideas are what Jenny does best.According to Jenny: "Some people might think that being 'furiously happy'
                is just an excuse to be stupid and irresponsible and invite a herd of kangaroos over to your house
                without telling your husband first because you suspect he would say no since he's never particularly
                liked kangaroos. And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their
                house. Two is the limit. I speak from personal experience. My husband says that none is the new limit. I
                say he should have been clearer about that before I rented all those kangaroos.""Most of my favorite
                people are dangerously fucked-up but you'd never guess because we've learned to bare it so honestly that
                it becomes the new normal. Like John Hughes wrote in The Breakfast Club, 'We're all pretty bizarre. Some
                of us are just better at hiding it.' Except go back and cross out the word 'hiding.'"Jenny's first book,
                LET'S PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED, was ostensibly about family, but deep down it was about celebrating
                your own weirdness. FURIOUSLY HAPPY is a book about mental illness, but under the surface it's about
                embracing joy in fantastic and outrageous ways-and who doesn't need a bit more of that? ...more

                But girls often allow fear to stand in their way.In The Gutsy Girl, author Caroline Paul emboldens girls
                to seek out a life of exhilaration. Once a young scaredy-cat herself, Caroline decided that fear got in
                the way of the life she wanted--of excitement, confidence, self-reliance, friendship, and fun. She has
                since flown planes, rafted big rivers, climbed tall mountains, and fought fires as one of the first
                female firefighters in San Francisco. In The Gutsy Girl, she shares her greatest escapades as well as
                those of other girls and women from throughout history, and offers engaging activities such as
                confidence-building stances, creating a compass, positive self-talk, and using crickets to estimate
                outside temperatures. Each section includes a place for girls to “journal” their adventures, thus
                encouraging a new generation to develop a zest for challenges and a healthy relationship to risk. The
                Gutsy Girl is Lean In for young girls, a book about the glorious things that happen when you unshackle
                from fear and open up to exhilaration. Fully illustrated and enlivened throughout by bestselling
                illustrator Wendy MacNaughton's whimsical pen-and-ink drawings. ...more

                with her bestseller on creativity, The Artist’s Way. In It’s Never Too Late To Begin Again, she turns
                her eye to a segment of the population that, ironically, while they have more time to be creative, are
                often reluctant or intimidated by the creative process. Cameron shows readers that retirement can, in
                fact, be the most rich, fulfilling, and creative time of their lives. When someone retires, the newfound
                freedom can be quite exciting, but also daunting. The life that someone had has changed, and the life to
                come is yet to be defined. In this book, Cameron shows readers how cultivating their creative selves can
                help them navigate this new terrain. She tells the inspiring stories of retirees who discovered new
                artistic pursuits and passions that more than filled their days—they nurtured their souls.   A

                day at hand. -  Artist Dates encourage fun and spontaneity. -  Solo Walks quell anxiety and clear the
                mind.This fun, gentle, step-by-step process will help you explore your creative dreams, wishes, and

            <description>In July 2008, illustrator and designer Christoph Niemann began Abstract City, a visual blog for
                the New York Times. His posts were inspired by the desire to re-create simple and everyday observations
                and stories from his own life that everyone could relate to. In Niemann’s hands, mundane experiences

                designer Christoph Niemann began Abstract City, a visual blog for the New York Times. His posts were
                inspired by the desire to re-create simple and everyday observations and stories from his own life that
                everyone could relate to. In Niemann’s hands, mundane experiences such as riding the subway or trying to
                get a good night’s sleep were transformed into delightful flights of visual fancy. The struggle to keep
                up with housework became a battle against adorable but crafty goblins, and nostalgia about New York
                manifested in simple but strikingly spot-on LEGO creations. This brilliantly illustrated collection of
                reflections on modern life includes all 16 of the original blog posts as well as a new chapter created
                exclusively for the book. Also available from Christoph Niemann: Sunday Sketching and I LEGO N.Y. Praise
                for Abstract City: “Everyday experiences—from looking at leaves to riding city subways—are funny and
                fresh and often a source of wonder when depicted by this brilliant graphic designer.” —Readers Digest “I
                will call Christoph when anything awful happens to me. And he will make me laugh like crazy about the
                whole thing. Because he is insanely funny and completely tenderly true. I love every column he did and
                will do.” —Maira Kalman, author/illustrator of And the Pursuit of Happiness “Christoph Niemann is the
                best illustrator alive. Every single time I come across a piece of his work, which is often as he either
                works all the time, or worse, draws incredibly fast, it is wonderful. While the rest of us are lucky to
                get a proper piece out here and there, Christoph produces hit after hit after hit. If he wasn’t such a
                genuinely sweet man, we’d surely hate his ass a lot.” —Stefan Sagmeister, author of Things I Have
                Learned in My Life So Far “Few books have more probingly and humorously gotten inside the mind and
                day-to-day experience of an artist.” —NPR.org "What’s terrifying (to me, certainly, and possibly to many
                of his peers) is that nearly every idea he has seems to be equally well formed . . . once again,
                performing neat, virtuosic circles around the rest of us, to our delight." —PRINT magazine

                the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000
                in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet,

                a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His
                name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car
                and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself.
                Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a party of moose hunters. How McCandless came to die
                is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991,
                McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes
                Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates,
                and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered
                by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature
                presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his
                desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. ...more

                and in the most unexpected of places. No other writer’s work has been performed, translated, adapted and
                altered in such a remarkable variety of cultures and languages. But what is it about William Shakespeare
                – a man from Warwickshire who never once set foot outside England – that has made him at home in so many
                places around the globe?Travelling across four continents, six countries and 400 years, Andrew Dickson
                takes us on a personal journey rich in insight and surprise. We enter the air-conditioned vault deep
                beneath Capitol Hill where the world’s largest collection of First Folios is stored; discover the
                shadowy history of Joseph Goebbels’s obsession with Shakespeare; and uncover the true story behind the

                When Joanna Connors was thirty years old on assignment for the Cleveland Plain Dealer to review a play
                at a college theater, she was held at knife point and raped by a stranger who had grown up five miles
                away from her. Once her assailant was caught and sentenced, Joanna never spo “This is it. My rape. I
                knew it was coming. Every woman knows. And now here it is. My turn.” When Joanna Connors was thirty
                years old on assignment for the Cleveland Plain Dealer to review a play at a college theater, she was
                held at knife point and raped by a stranger who had grown up five miles away from her. Once her
                assailant was caught and sentenced, Joanna never spoke of the trauma again, until 21 years later when
                her daughter was about to go to college. She resolved then to tell her children about her own rape so
                they could learn and protect themselves, and she began to realize that the man who assaulted her was one

            <description>Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new
                research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence. Like
                humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed
                with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are
                astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival
                primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.  Like humans, many birds have
                enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow
                them to punch well above their weight. In The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman
                explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world
                to the most cutting-edge frontiers of research— the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia,
                the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged
                mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western
                states—Ackerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves
                deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it
                means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clark’s nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many
                as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the
                mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand
                times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where it’s going, even thousands of miles
                from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But
                beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the
                impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong
                sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They
                cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their
                young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the
                death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves
                personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both
                give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds
                can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written, The Genius of
                Birds richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more

            <description>“I’m a person who listens for a living. I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not
                shouting to be heard. This book chronicles some of what I’ve learned in what has become a conversation
                across time and generations, across disciplines and denominations.” Peabody Award-winning broadcaster
                and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extr “I’m a person who listens
                for a living.  I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not shouting to be heard.  This book
                chronicles some of what I’ve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations,
                across disciplines and denominations.”   Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities
                Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining the great questions of
                meaning for our time. The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast, On Being,
                has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage.
                Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many
                others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation.  
                In Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its
                many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master
                class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching
                faculty.   The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once,
                Tippett says – definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and
                family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek
                emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be
                human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other.   This book offers a
                grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century – of personal growth but also renewed
                public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this
                century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as
                muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive
                simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering
                braid.   One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of
                the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end. But presence does
                not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo. Indeed Tippett and her teachers are people whose
                work meets, and often drives, powerful forces of change alive in the world today. In the end, perhaps
                the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius Tippett harvests in Becoming Wise is
                the strength to meet the world where it really is, and then to make it better. ...more

                neighbors.Johnson argues that learning to see the world afresh, like a child, shifts the way we think
                about nature: Instead of something distant and abstract, nature becomes real—all at once comical,
                annoying, and beautiful. This shift can add tremendous value to our lives, and it might just be the
                first step in saving the world.No matter where we live—city, country, oceanside, ormountains—there are
                wonders that we walk past every day. Unseen City widens the pinhole of our perspective by allowing us to
                view the world from the high-altitude eyes of a turkey vulture and the distinctly low-altitude eyes of a
                snail. The narrative allows us to eavesdrop on the comically frenetic life of a squirrel and peer deep
                into the past with a ginkgo biloba tree. Each of these organisms has something unique to tell us about
                our neighborhoods and, chapter by chapter, Unseen City takes us on a journey that is part nature lesson
                and part love letter to the world’s urban jungles. With the right perspective, a walk to the subway can
                be every bit as entrancing as a walk through a national park. ...more

            <description>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER •In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the
                Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal
                dialogue on the subject closest to his heart—mercy—which has long been the cornerstone of his faith and
                is now the central teaching of his papacy. In this conversation with Vatican r NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER
                • In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope
                Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal dialogue on the subject closest to his
                heart—mercy—which has long been the cornerstone of his faith and is now the central teaching of his
                papacy. In this conversation with Vatican reporter Andrea Tornielli, Francis explains—through memories
                from his youth and moving anecdotes from his experiences as a pastor—why “mercy is the first attribute
                of God.” God “does not want anyone to be lost. His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,” he
                writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts—on the contrary, its duty
                is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume
                responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done. The first Jesuit and the first
                South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God’s
                message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, The Name of God Is Mercy
                resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and
                reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds. It is being published in more than
                eighty countries around the world.“The name of God is mercy. There are no situations we cannot get out
                of, we are not condemned to sink into quicksand.”—Pope FrancisPraise for The Name of God Is Mercy
                “Francis speaks succinctly—and with refreshing forthrightness. . . . He emphasizes moral sincerity over
                dogma, an understanding of the complexities of the world and individual experience over rigid doctrine.
                . . . The pope has an easy conversational style that moves effortlessly between folksy sayings and
                erudite allusions, between common-sense logic and impassioned philosophical insights.”—Michiko Kakutani,
                The New York Times“What makes his book most moving is the way in which this man, without disrespecting
                his own privacy or offering false bromides of modesty, opens the sacred space of his conscience to
                explain how he came to center his ministry, and now his papacy, around mercy.”—James Carroll, The New
                Yorker“As he has done throughout his papacy, Pope Francis shows in this book a compelling way to present
                God’s love anew to a skeptical world without denying the ancient teachings of faith. But now he is
                challenging the entire Church to trek a new way forward.”—Time “Francis enjoys sharing personal stories
                of God’s grace and mercy in the lives of parishioners from his native Argentina, people he has known and
                who have recognized themselves as sinners.”—The Washington Post“Powerful . . . Francis’s book signals a
                plea for a change of attitude on the part of the faithful and their pastors. . . . Bishops and priests
                will talk and quarrel over the text for months, even years to come. And that, perhaps, is what Francis
                intends.”—Financial Times “Deepens his calls for a more merciful Catholic Church . . . The
                question-and-answer book is told in simple, breezy language, with the pope referring to experiences and
                people in his own life.”—Newsday “Francis has offered his most detailed outline yet for the role of the
                Catholic church in the modern era.”—National Catholic ReporterTranslated by Oonagh Stransky From the

                results that range from merely frustrating to catastrophic:The space shuttle Challenger exploded in part
                because the engineers were reviewing a limited sample set.Millions of women avoid caffeine during

                trainingAfter decades of off-shoring and downsizing that have left blue collar workers obsolete and
                stranded, the United States is now on the verge of an industrial renaissance. But w From Katherine
                Newman, award-winning author of No Shame in My Game, and sociologist Hella Winston, a sharp and
                irrefutable call to reenergize this nation's long-neglected system of vocational trainingAfter decades
                of off-shoring and downsizing that have left blue collar workers obsolete and stranded, the United
                States is now on the verge of an industrial renaissance. But we don't have a skilled enough labor pool
                to fill the positions that will be created, which are in many cases technically demanding and require
                specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of
                getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system.
                Touted as a progressive, egalitarian institution providing opportunity even to those with the greatest
                need, the American secondary school system has in fact deepened existing inequalities.We can do better,
                argue acclaimed sociologists Katherine Newman and Hella Winston. Taking a page from the successful
                experience of countries like Germany and Austria, where youth unemployment is a mere 7%, they call for a
                radical reevaluation of the idea of vocational training, long discredited as an instrument of tracking.
                The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to
                value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education. By doing so, we will not only be able to
                meet the growing demand for skilled employees in dozens of sectors where employers decry the absence of
                well trained workers -- we will make the American Dream accessible to all. ...more

                an animal’s? Maybe you think it’s your ability to design tools, your sense of self, or your grasp of
                past and future—all traits that have helped us define ourselves as the planet’s preeminent species. But
                in recent decades, these claims have eroded, or even been disproven outright, by a revolution in the
                study of animal cognition. Take the way octopuses use coconut shells as tools; elephants that classify
                humans by age, gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash
                memory puts that of humans to shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps,
                bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth
                of animal intelligence. He offers a firsthand account of how science has stood traditional behaviorism
                on its head by revealing how smart animals really are, and how we’ve underestimated their abilities for
                too long.People often assume a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own intelligence
                at the top. But what if it is more like a bush, with cognition taking different forms that are often
                incomparable to ours? Would you presume yourself dumber than a squirrel because you’re less adept at
                recalling the locations of hundreds of buried acorns? Or would you judge your perception of your
                surroundings as more sophisticated than that of a echolocating bat? De Waal reviews the rise and fall of
                the mechanistic view of animals and opens our minds to the idea that animal minds are far more intricate
                and complex than we have assumed. De Waal’s landmark work will convince you to rethink everything you
                thought you knew about animal—and human—intelligence. ...more

                television personality reveals with humor and style how Jesus' extravagant grace is the key to dealing
                with life's biggest challenge: people.The majority of our joys, struggles, thrills, and heartbreaks

                ourselves to, and judge. People are the best and worst thing about the human life.Jen Hatmaker knows
                this all too well, and so she reveals how to practice kindness, grace, truthfulness, vision, and love to
                ourselves and those around us. By doing this, For the Love leads our generation to reimagine Jesus'
                grace as a way of life, and it does it in a funny yet profound manner that Christian readers will love.
                Along the way, Hatmaker shows readers how to reclaim their prophetic voices and become Good News again
                to a hurting, polarized world. ...more

                anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child. This is a stunning book of electric honesty and
                passion. Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter,
                Quintana, fall ill.At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was
                put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later - the night before New Year's Eve - the
                Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and
                fatal coronary.In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later,
                their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and
                underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful
                book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I

                sanity, about life itself'. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal
                experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad. ...more

                twenty-four others before taking their own lives.For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan’s

                1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Over the
                course of minutes, they would kill twelve students and a teacher and wound twenty-four others before
                taking their own lives. For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan’s mother, has lived with the
                indescribable grief and shame of that day. How could her child, the promising young man she had loved
                and raised, be responsible for such horror? And how, as his mother, had she not known something was
                wrong? Were there subtle signs she had missed? What, if anything, could she have done differently? These
                are questions that Klebold has grappled with every day since the Columbine tragedy. In A Mother’s
                Reckoning, she chronicles with unflinching honesty her journey as a mother trying to come to terms with
                the incomprehensible. In the hope that the insights and understanding she has gained may help other
                families recognize when a child is in distress, she tells her story in full, drawing upon her personal
                journals, the videos and writings that Dylan left behind, and on countless interviews with mental health
                experts. Filled with hard-won wisdom and compassion, A Mother’s Reckoning is a powerful and haunting
                book that sheds light on one of the most pressing issues of our time. And with fresh wounds from the
                recent Newtown and Charleston shootings, never has the need for understanding been more urgent. Author

            <description>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of
                life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored
                in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished.
                Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's
                memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its
                lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including
                Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the
                experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering,
                but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.
                Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos ("meaning")--holds that our primary
                drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally
                find meaningful.At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10
                million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked
                readers to name a "book that made a difference in your life" found Man's Search for Meaning among the
                ten most influential books in America. ...more

                Beam spent most of her childhood in and out of hospitals with a rare and incurable digestive disorder
                that prevented her from ever living a normal, healthy life. One sunny day when she was able to go
                outside and play with her sisters, she fell three stories headfirst inside an old, hollowed-out tree, a
                fall that may well have caused death or paralysis. Implausibly, she survived without a scratch. While
                unconscious inside the tree, with rescue workers struggling to get to her, she visited heaven. After
                being released from the hospital, she defied science and was inexplicably cured of her chronic ailment.

                connect with other people? Does technology draw us closer together or trap us An expertly crafted work
                of reportage, memoir and biography on the subject of loneliness told through the lives of iconic
                artists, by the acclaimed author of The Trip to Echo Spring What does it mean to be lonely? How do we
                live, if we're not intimately engaged with another human being? How do we connect with other people?
                Does technology draw us closer together or trap us behind screens?When Olivia Laing moved to New York
                City in her mid-thirties, she found herself inhabiting loneliness on a daily basis. Increasingly
                fascinated by this most shameful of experiences, she began to explore the lonely city by way of art.
                Moving fluidly between works and lives - from Edward Hopper's Nighthawks to Andy Warhol's Time Capsules,
                from Henry Darger's hoarding to the depredations of the AIDS crisis - Laing conducts an electric,
                dazzling investigation into what it means to be alone, illuminating not only the causes of loneliness
                but also how it might be resisted and redeemed.Humane, provocative and deeply moving, The Lonely City is
                about the spaces between people and the things that draw them together, about sexuality, mortality and
                the magical possibilities of art. It's a celebration of a strange and lovely state, adrift from the
                larger continent of human experience, but intrinsic to the very act of being alive. ...more

                "one of the great clinical writers of the twentieth century" (The New York Times) recounts the case
                histories of patients lost in the bizarre, apparently inescapable world of neurological disorders.
                Oliver Sacks's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with
                fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them
                the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are
                stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become
                alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical
                talents.If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks's splendid and sympathetic
                telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable
                us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live
                and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicine's ultimate responsibility: "the
                suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject." ...more

            <description>Deeds's subtle, meticulous, and wildly imaginative pencil and crayon drawings portray an
                unusual cast of characters: nineteenth-century dandies, Civil War soldiers, antique cars, fantastic
                boats and trains, country landscapes dotted with roaming animals, and fanciful architecture. None of
                these existed in the actual mid-twentieth-century landscape of Deeds's own life, but Deeds's subtle,
                meticulous, and wildly imaginative pencil and crayon drawings portray an unusual cast of characters:
                nineteenth-century dandies, Civil War soldiers, antique cars, fantastic boats and trains, country
                landscapes dotted with roaming animals, and fanciful architecture. None of these existed in the actual
                mid-twentieth-century landscape of Deeds's own life, but rather were representations of his inner
                world—an artist's poignant tribute to a faded past.Deeds lovingly bound his artwork in a cardboard and
                leather portfolio, a present for his mother. After being accidentally discarded in 1970, the album was
                rescued from the trash by a young boy and, thirty-six years later, came into the hands of artist and
                collector Harris Diamant, who provides the book's foreword. The Electric Pencil features all 283 of
                Deeds's arresting drawings—now avidly collected—done on ledger sheets from State Hospital No. 3 in
                Nevada, Missouri, and reproduced in the sequence of the original album. The Electric Pencil introduces
                readers to an astonishing record of one man's unwavering artistic vision in the face of the most
                inhospitable conditions. ...more

                humor, and wit, Trespassing Across America is both a fascinating account of one man’s remarkable journey
                along the Keystone XL pipeline and a meditation on climate change, the beauty of the natural world, and
                the extremes to which we can push ourselves—both physically and mentally.  It started as a far-fetched
                idea—to hike the entire length of the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline. But in the months that
                followed, it grew into something more for Ken Ilgunas. It became an irresistible adventure—an
                opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits. So in
                September 2012, he strapped on his backpack, stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of Denver,
                and hitchhiked 1,500 miles to the Alberta tar sands. Once there, he turned around and began his
                1,700-mile trek to the XL’s endpoint on the Gulf Coast of Texas, a journey he would complete entirely on
                foot, walking almost exclusively across private property.Both a travel memoir and a reflection on
                climate change, Trespassing Across America is filled with colorful characters, harrowing physical
                trials, and strange encounters with the weather, terrain, and animals of America’s plains. A tribute to
                the Great Plains and the people who live there, Ilgunas’s memoir grapples with difficult questions about
                our place in the world: What is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land? As members of a
                rapidly warming planet? As mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel
                industry? Ultimately, Trespassing Across America is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not
                half wild is a life only half lived. ...more

                for: the profound pleasure of being swept into vivid new worlds, worlds peopled by characters so
                intriguing and real that we can't shake them, even long after the reading's done. In his earlier,
                award-winning novels, Dominic Smith demonstrated a gift for coaxing the past to life. Now, in The Last
                Painting of Sara de Vos, he deftly bridges the historical and the contemporary, tracking a collision
                course between a rare landscape by a female Dutch painter of the golden age, an inheritor of the work in
                1950s Manhattan, and a celebrated art historian who painted a forgery of it in her youth.In 1631, Sara
                de Vos is admitted as a master painter to the Guild of St. Luke's in Holland, the first woman to be so
                recognized. Three hundred years later, only one work attributed to de Vos is known to remain--a haunting
                winter scene, At the Edge of a Wood, which hangs over the bed of a wealthy descendant of the original
                owner. An Australian grad student, Ellie Shipley, struggling to stay afloat in New York, agrees to paint
                a forgery of the landscape, a decision that will haunt her. Because now, half a century later, she's
                curating an exhibit of female Dutch painters, and both versions threaten to arrive. As the three threads
                intersect, The Last Painting of Sara de Vos mesmerizes while it grapples with the demands of the
                artistic life, showing how the deceits of the past can forge the present. ...more

                quest for freedom, and the desire to have a voice in the world—and it is now the newest Oprah’s Book
                Club 2.0 selection.Hetty “Handful” Grimke, an urban slave in early nineteenth century Charleston, yearns
                for life beyond the suffocating walls that enclose her within the wealthy Grimke household. The Grimke’s
                daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is
                hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh
                birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow
                their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own,
                dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt,
                defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful
                will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience
                crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place
                alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and
                women’s rights movements.Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record
                to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including
                Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.This
                exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating
                wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression
                will leave no reader unmoved. ...more

                Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into
                her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and
                suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences.   For the ambitious young German
                doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate
                life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power.
                  The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is
                sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross
                continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to
                those whom history has forgotten. ...more

                Paris!When April Vogt's boss tells her about an apartment in the ninth arrondissement that has been
                discovered after being shuttered for the past seventy years, the Sotheby's continental furniture
                specialist does not hear the words “dust” or “rats” or “decrepit.” She hears Paris. She hears
                escape.Once in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder's repository.
                Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted
                ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there's a portrait by one of the
                masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the
                very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned
                courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April's quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and
                Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It's about discovering the story behind this
                charismatic woman.It's about discovering two women, actually.With the help of a salty (and annoyingly
                sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan's private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets
                buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe's life, April can't help but take a deeper look into
                her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a
                career she's been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life
                too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond
                flaky pâtisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy
                finales.Whether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of
                the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events,
                Michelle Gable's A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and
                successes of two very unforgettable women. ...more

                Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter
                from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written
                inside a book by Charles Lamb….As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn
                into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey

                breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of

                correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the
                impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail
                for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.Written with warmth and humor as a series of
                letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in
                the most surprising ways. ...more

                Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, written by his direct descendant and a Dracula historian Bram
                Stoker's Dracula is the prototypical horror novel, an inspiration for the world's seemingly limitless
                fascination with vampires. Though many have tried to replicate Stoker's horror classic—in books,
                television shows, and movies—only the 1931 Bela Lugosi film bore the Stoker family's support. Until now.
                Dracula The Un-Dead is a bone-chilling sequel based on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for
                characters and plot threads excised from the original edition. Dracula The Un-Dead begins in 1912,
                twenty-five years after Dracula "crumbled into dust." Van Helsing's protégé, Dr. Jack Seward, is now a
                disgraced morphine addict obsessed with stamping out evil across Europe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey
                Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon
                the troubled production of "Dracula," directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself. The play plunges
                Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences
                evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a
                quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is
                seeking revenge? Or is there another force at work whose relentless purpose is to destroy anything and
                anyone associated with Dracula? Dracula The Un-Dead is deeply researched, rich in character, thrills and
                scares, and lovingly crafted as both an extension and celebration of one of the most classic popular
                novels in literature. ...more

                children.Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with
                the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.The story
                remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they
                discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.Of
                course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was
                prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children
                wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an
                ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through
                their walls and consume all their dreams. ...more

                . . . Ripping suspense, sheer terror, and a wrenching love story.” —Sandra Brown, New York Times
                bestselling author of FrictionThe terrible truth about Manderley is that someone is always watching.
                Manderley Resort is a gleaming, new twenty-story hotel on the California coast. It’s about to open its
                doors, and the world--at least those with the means to afford it--will be welcomed into a palace of
                opulence and unparalleled security. But someone is determined that Manderley will never open. The staff
                has no idea that their every move is being watched, and over the next twelve hours they will be killed
                off, one by one. Writing in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King, and with a deep bow to
                Daphne du Maurier, author Gina Wohlsdorf pairs narrative ingenuity and razor-wire prose with quick
                twists, sharp turns, and gasp-inducing terror. Security is grand guignol storytelling at its very best.
                A shocking thriller, a brilliant narrative puzzle, and a multifaceted love story unlike any other,
                Security marks the debut of a fearless and gifted writer. “Be surprised, be very surprised: Gina
                Wohlsdorf brings more than just plot twists and a terrifically tender love story to this thriller . . .
                It’s her playful homage to Hitchcock and du Maurier that had me reading, howling, and just plain loving
                this novel.” —Sara Gruen, author of At the Water’s Edge “Grand Hotel meets Psycho in the age of
                surveillance . . . Security is cinematically vivid, crisply written, and sharp enough to cut . . .
                Wohlsdorf brilliantly subverts our expectations of the action genre in this smart, shocking, poignant
                thriller.” —Emily Croy Barker, author of The Thinking Woman’s Guide to Real Magic “The thrill of this
                novel goes beyond its wickedly clever,  split-screen, high-tech wizardry—a kind of video gamer’s
                literary retake of Hitchcock’s Rear Window--and emanates  from its strange, disembodied narrator . . .
                The effect is terrifying, sexy, dizzying, and impossible to look away from.” —Tim Johnston, author of
                Descent “Shocking and filled with Tarantino-ish dark humor. . . Structurally reminiscent of the amazing
                Jennifer Egan,Wohlsdorf’s book is certainly a hybrid, like nothing else. Get ready.” —Ann Beattie,
                author of The State We’re In “Flawless . . . Security is perfectly tuned for blockbuster status . . .
                They don’t make a hotel big enough to house all the people who will want to read this, and soon, as in
                Manderley, all eyes will be on Wohlsdorf.” —Daniel Kraus, Booklist, starred review   ...more

                Medical science and governments around the world scramble in an effort to solve the problem, but
                twenty-five years later there is no cure, and an entire generation grows up with a population of fewer
                than a thousand women.Zoey and some of the surviving young women are housed in a scientific research
                compound dedicated to determining the cause. For two decades, she’s been isolated from her family,
                treated as a test subject, and locked away—told only that the virus has wiped out the rest of the
                world’s population.Captivity is the only life Zoey has ever known, and escaping her heavily armed
                captors is no easy task, but she’s determined to leave before she is subjected to the next round of
                tests…a program that no other woman has ever returned from. Even if she’s successful, Zoey has no idea
                what she’ll encounter in the strange new world beyond the facility’s walls. Winning her freedom will
                take brutality she never imagined she possessed, as well as all her strength and cunning—but Zoey is

                stable society apart, the "New Normal" is a Soft Apocalypse. This is how our world ends; with a whimper

                previous social structures begin to dissolve. Locus Award finalist and John W. Campbell Memorial Award
                finalist Soft Apocalypse follows the journey across the Southeast of a tribe of formerly middle class
                Americans as they struggle to find a place for themselves and their children in a new, dangerous world

                in the tradition of Michael Crichton, World War Z, and The Martian, Sleeping Giants is a thriller fueled
                by an earthshaking mystery—and a fight to control a gargantuan power.A girl named Rose is riding her new
                bike near her home in Deadwood, South Dakota, when she falls through the earth. She wakes up at the
                bottom of a square hole, its walls glowing with intricate carvings. But the firemen who come to save her
                peer down upon something even stranger: a little girl in the palm of a giant metal hand.Seventeen years
                later, the mystery of the bizarre artifact remains unsolved—its origins, architects, and purpose
                unknown. Its carbon dating defies belief; military reports are redacted; theories are floated, then
                rejected.But some can never stop searching for answers.Rose Franklin is now a highly trained physicist
                leading a top secret team to crack the hand’s code. And along with her colleagues, she is being
                interviewed by a nameless interrogator whose power and purview are as enigmatic as the provenance of the
                relic. What’s clear is that Rose and her compatriots are on the edge of unraveling history’s most
                perplexing discovery—and figuring out what it portends for humanity. But once the pieces of the puzzle
                are in place, will the result prove to be an instrument of lasting peace or a weapon of mass
                destruction? ...more

                Praise for Caroline Mitchell:‘Fan-bloody-tastic! I enjoyed this book so much that I forced myself to
                read slowly as I just could not bear for it to end… I thought the story was brilliant. The characters
                were creative and kept me hooked. ‘The twists and turns kept me gasping for more… Could not recommend
                this book any more highly!’ Crime Book Junkie ‘This is a well written supernatural detective story, with
                a surprising twist that I guarantee will keep you glued to the last page… at times I couldn’t turn the
                pages quickly enough, it’s atmospheric, gritty and at times just plain scary, and what a twist at the
                end.’ The Book Review Café ‘With a brilliant cast of crime characters, and a plot that was enough to
                make me feel dizzy, this was a compelling book that I just couldn't get enough of. Every word, every
                page, every murder, every guess... I couldn't wait for the final piece of the jigsaw to fit into place…
                the word 'thrilling' just doesn't do this justice.’ Becca’s Books ...more

                13-year-old Lilix Morgan is found alive and floating on a bed of ice at sea, everyone counts it a
                miracle. Kidnapped nearly four weeks earlier, she remembers nothing of her mysterious abduction. When
                she tries to remember what happened, she hears only a melody – a faint and delicate set of notes, strung
                together in a tune she doesn’t understand. THEIR POWER, UNMATCHED.A year later and desperate to put the
                lingering nightmares of her past behind her, Lilix crosses the country to enroll at Baelmorte Academy,
                aiming to become the violinist she once dreamt of. Things seem to be finally going well, and Lilix
                settles into a routine of sheet music and inspiration among new friends.Then the dreams start. The
                melody and night terrors she thought she’d left behind return with a vengeance, threatening to ruin her
                fragile version of normalcy. Then an unlikely ally tells her that she isn’t alone. That there are others
                just like her, fighting to hide their own shocking truths from coming to light. That they know who she
                is, and what she’s been through. Now, accompanied by four other girls, Lilix discovers her nightmares
                are larger than a single trauma; they’re a window to a hidden part of her soul, a place of immense power
                with a destiny that cannot be ignored. THEIR BATTLE, IS ONLY BEGINNING.With this knowledge comes a new
                and frightening reality. For Lilix has been reawakened to stop an age-old enemy, one thought to have
                been destroyed centuries ago. Trapped by her destiny, Lilix is torn between what feels right and what
                she remembers. Her memories tell her of a star-crossed love waiting to be reunited, of friendships and
                trust broken in the past. But can she save that love when reality brings her an enemy, and an evil that
                will be the undoing of them all if they don’t destroy it? ...more

                BESTSELLER • In this powerful and uplifting novel, a mother and her daughter-in-law bravely leave their
                troubled marriages and face the challenge of starting over. Leaning on each other, Nichole and Leanne
                discover that their inner strength and capacity for love are greater than they ever imagined. When
                Nichole discovers that her husband, Jake, has been unfaithful, the illusion of her perfect life is
                indelibly shattered. While juggling her young son, a new job, and volunteer work, Nichole meets Rocco,
                who is the opposite of Jake in nearly every way. Though blunt-spoken and rough around the edges, Rocco
                proves to be a dedicated father and thoughtful friend. But just as their relationship begins to blossom,
                Jake wagers everything on winning Nichole back—including their son Owen’s happiness. Somehow, Nichole
                must find the courage to defy her fears and follow her heart, with far-reaching consequences for them
                all. Leanne has quietly ignored her husband’s cheating for decades, but is jolted into action by the
                echo of Nichole’s all-too-familiar crisis. While volunteering as a teacher of English as a second
                language, Leanne meets Nikolai, a charming, talented baker from Ukraine. Resolved to avoid the heartache
                and complications of romantic entanglements, Leanne nonetheless finds it difficult to resist Nikolai’s
                effusive overtures—until an unexpected tragedy tests the very fabric of her commitments. An inspiring
                novel of friendship, reinvention, and hope, A Girl’s Guide to Moving On affirms the ability of every
                woman to forge a new path, believe in love, and fearlessly find happiness.Praise for A Girl’s Guide to
                Moving On “Debbie Macomber’s finest novel. Betrayal and sorrow can happen in any stage of life and, in
                this wonderful story, her very nimble hands weave a spectacular kaleidoscope of courage, struggles, and
                finally joyous redemption and reinvention. Macomber totally understands the human heart. I absolutely
                loved it!”—Dorothea Benton Frank, New York Times bestselling author of All the Single Ladies “Whispers a
                message of love, hope, and, yes, reinvention to every woman who has ever wondered ‘Is that all there
                is?’ I predict every diehard Macomber fan—as well as legions of readers new to the Macomber magic—will
                be cheering for Leanne and Nichole, and clamoring for more, more, more.”—Mary Kay Andrews, New York

                Lord Richard Vane is the confidant on whom everyone depends for advice, moral rectitude, and discreet
                assistance. Yet when Richard has a problem, he turns to his valet, a fixer of unparalleled genius—and
                the object of Richard’s deepest desires. If there is one rule a gentleman must follow, it is never to
                dally with servants. But when David is close enough to touch, the rules of class collide with the basest
                sort of animal instinct: overpowering lust.   For David Cyprian, burglary and blackmail are as much in a
                day’s work as bootblacking—anything for the man he’s devoted to. But the one thing he wants for himself
                is the one thing Richard refuses to give: his heart. With the tension between them growing to be
                unbearable, David’s seemingly incorruptible master has left him no choice. Putting his finely honed
                skills of seduction and manipulation to good use, he will convince Richard to forget all about his
                well-meaning objections and give in to sweet, sinful temptation.  Includes a special message from the

                wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at
                Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once
                been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the
                daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks,
                Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father,
                rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would
                never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and
                Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human
                heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...Did
                You Know?-That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?That Landon is the name of his third

            <description>You are what you love. But you might not love what you think.In this book, award-winning author
                James K. A. Smith shows that who and what we worship fundamentally shape our hearts. And while we desire
                to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our
                hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we You are what you love. But you
                might not love what you think.In this book, award-winning author James K. A. Smith shows that who and
                what we worship fundamentally shape our hearts. And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often
                aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival
                gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of
                culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the
                "imagination station" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed
                toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers
                should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his
                influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a
                more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of
                Smith's popular presentations on the ideas presented in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up
                rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers
                and includes material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work. He also suggests
                individual and communal practices for shaping the Christian life. ...more

                One of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, Armstrong traces the history of how men and

                liberation in simply not being a jerk.” — Eihei Dogen (1200–1253 CE)The Shobogenzo (The Treasury of the

                Paraphrasing of Dogen’s Treasury of the True Dharma Eye“Even if the whole universe is nothing but a
                bunch of jerks doing all kinds of jerk-type things, there is still liberation in simply not being a
                jerk.” — Eihei Dogen (1200–1253 CE)The Shobogenzo (The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) is a revered
                eight-hundred-year-old Zen Buddhism classic written by the Japanese monk Eihei Dogen. Despite the
                timeless wisdom of his teachings, many consider the book difficult to understand and daunting to read.
                In Don’t Be a Jerk, Zen priest and bestselling author Brad Warner, through accessible paraphrasing and
                incisive commentary, applies Dogen’s teachings to modern times. While entertaining and sometimes
                irreverent, Warner is also an astute scholar who sees in Dogen very modern psychological concepts, as
                well as insights on such topics as feminism and reincarnation. Warner even shows that Dogen offered a
                “Middle Way” in the currently raging debate between science and religion. For curious readers worried
                that Dogen’s teachings are too philosophically opaque, Don’t Be a Jerk is hilarious, understandable, and
                wise. ...more

                successful company or career.In 1984, it looked like an unwinnable David and Goliath struggle: one guy
                against the mammoth American beer industry. When others scoffed at Jim Koch’s plan to leave his
                consulting job and start a brewery that would challenge American palates, he chose a nineteenth-century
                family recipe and launched Samuel Adams. Now one of America’s leading craft breweries, Samuel Adams has
                redefined the way Americans think about beer and helped spur a craft beer revolution.In Quench Your Own
                Thirst, Koch offers unprecedented insights into the whirlwind ride from scrappy start-up to thriving
                public company. His innovative business model and refreshingly frank stories offer counterintuitive
                lessons that you can apply to business and to life.Koch covers everything from finding your own Yoda to
                his theory on how a piece of string can teach you the most important lesson you’ll ever learn about
                business. He also has surprising advice on sales, marketing, hiring, and company culture. Koch’s
                anecdotes, quirky musings, and bits of wisdom go far beyond brewing. A fun, engaging guide for building
                a career or launching a successful business based on your passions, Quench Your Own Thirst is the key to
                the ultimate dream: being successful while doing what you love. ...more

                business. Fundraising is hard. This book gives you the roadmap to get where you are going. Alejandro
                Cremades speaks with wisdom and from experience.“ - Tim Draper , Founder of Draper Associates, DFJ, and
                Draper University."The Art of Startup Fundraising should be a mandatory reading for entrepreneurs that

            <description>Mark Twain once observed, “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get
                its boots on.” His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health
                scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas–business people, teachers,
                politicians, journalists, and others–struggle to make their ideas “stick.” Why Mark Twain once observed,
                “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” His observation
                rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly.
                Meanwhile, people with important ideas–business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and
                others–struggle to make their ideas “stick.” Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we
                improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip
                and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of
                ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the “human scale principle,”
                using the “Velcro Theory of Memory,” and creating “curiosity gaps.”In this indispensable guide, we
                discover that sticky messages of all kinds–from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s
                lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony–draw their power from the same six
                traits.Made to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It’s a fast-paced tour
                of success stories (and failures)–the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to
                prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of “the Mother Teresa Effect”; the
                elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative,
                eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning
                ideas–and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick. ...more

                of a traditional career and the upside of entrepreneurship? Why not have both?Becoming a full-time
                entrepreneur can look glamorous from the outside. Who doesn’t want to chase their dreams, be their own
                boss, and do what they love? But the truth is that entrepreneurship is often a slog, with no regular
                hours, no job security, and very little pay.  What if there was a way to have the stability of a day job
                with the excitement of a startup? All of the benefits of entrepreneurship with none of the pitfalls? In
                The 10% Entrepreneur, Patrick McGinnis shows you how, by investing just 10% of your time and resources,
                you can become an entrepreneur without losing a steady paycheck.  McGinnis details a step-by-step plan
                that takes you from identifying your first entrepreneurial project to figuring out the smartest way to
                commit resources to it. He shows you how to select and engage in projects that will provide you with
                upside outside the office while making your better at your day job. He also profiles real-world 10%
                Entrepreneurs such as...•Luke Holden, a cash-strapped recent college graduate, who started his own
                lobster-roll empire and oversaw much of its first year of operations, all while working full time in
                corporate America•Dipali Patwa, a designer and mom whose side project designing and selling infant
                clothing is now a sensation.•A group of friends who met at a 6am Bible study class and went on to start
                a brewery that now generates millions in sales . A successful 10% Entrepreneur himself, McGinnis
                explains the multiple paths you can follow to invest your cash, time, and expertise in a
                start-up—including as a founder, angel, adviser, or aficionado. Most importantly, you don’t have to have
                millions in disposable income to become a 10% Entrepreneur. When you put McGinnis’s 10% principles into
                action, you’ll quickly start racking up small wins, then watch as they snowball into your new (and far
                more entrepreneurial) life. ...more

                memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the
                company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic,
                game-changing, and profitable brands.In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50
                from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic
                shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed
                $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne
                plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the
                most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has
                always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry,
                he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he
                decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic,
                different.Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along
                with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and
                employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together,
                harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they
                built a brand that changed everything. ...more

            <description>Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new
                approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are
                launched. Eric Ries defines a startup asan organization dedicated to creating something new under

                fail. But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted
                across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines
                a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme
                uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a
                Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to
                discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that
                are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by
                lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as
                well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual
                progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company
                to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting
                time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all
                sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides
                a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to
                innovate more than ever. ...more

                others rediscovered the long-buried glory of Machu Picchu.   In this lively tale of events,
                achievements, and scandals from throughout the museum’s history. Readers will encounter renowned
                paleontologist O. C. Marsh who engaged in ferocious combat with his “Bone Wars” rival Edward Drinker

                Tuchman--the acclaimed author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning classic The Guns of August--once again
                marshals her gift for character, history, and sparkling prose to compose an astonishing portrait of
                medieval Europe.The fourteenth century reflects two contradictory images: on the one hand, a glittering
                age of crusades, cathedrals, and chivalry; on the other, a world plunged into chaos and spiritual agony.
                In this revelatory work, Tuchman examines not only the great rhythms of history but the grain and
                texture of domestic life: what childhood was like; what marriage meant; how money, taxes, and war
                dominated the lives of serf, noble, and clergy alike. Granting her subjects their loyalties,
                treacheries, and guilty passions, Tuchman re-creates the lives of proud cardinals, university scholars,
                grocers and clerks, saints and mystics, lawyers and mercenaries, and, dominating all, the knight--in all
                his valor and “furious follies,” a “terrible worm in an iron cocoon.” ...more

                trying to impress. They have gotten caught on tape doing and saying things they really shouldn't have.
                They have denied knowing about the underhanded doings of underlings — only to have a paper trail lead
                straight back to them. Nowadays, it seems like half of what we hear about politicians isn't about laws
                or governing, but is instead coverage focused on shenanigans, questionable morals, and scandals too
                numerous to count. And while we shake our heads in disbelief, we still can't resist poring over the

                William L. Shirer gave us the definitive book on Hitler's German Empire. Based on his personal
                experiences as a war correspondent as well as the voluminous documents that came out of Germany after
                the war, this thrilling account of Hitler's reign is widely acclaimed to be one of the greatest

                got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from

            <description>Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors
                began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and
                weapons. Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal
                origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing Although we
                usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first
                technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons. Over time, eight key
                technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons,
                the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body,
                enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic
                communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process.
                The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and
                the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the
                industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies
                may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of
                primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and
                retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other
                Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect
                of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. Unbound explains both how
                we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future.Technology:
                “The deliberate modification of any natural object or substance with forethought to achieve a specific
                end or to serve a specific purpose.” ...more

                coast against the men of the U.S. Merchant Marine who were supplying the European war, and one
                community’s monumental contribution to that effortPraise for The Mathews Men“The German U-Boat war

                unheralded heroic stories of World War II: the U-boat assault off the American coast against the men of
                the U.S. Merchant Marine who were supplying the European war, and one community’s monumental
                contribution to that effortPraise for The Mathews Men“The German U-Boat war against American merchant
                men was deadly and dramatic—in World War II, the U.S. Merchant Marine had twice the fatality rate of the
                U.S. Navy. William Geroux has unearthed a fascinating tale of one small coastal town caught in the thick
                of the fight, and he tells it with a sharp reporter’s eye and a real feel for the heroic men who went
                down to the sea in ships.” —Evan Thomas, author of Being Nixon and Sea of ThunderMathews County,
                Virginia, is a remote outpost on the Chesapeake Bay with little to offer except unspoiled scenery—but it
                sent one of the largest concentrations of sea captains and U.S. merchant mariners of any community in
                America to fight in World War II. The Mathews Men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one
                extraordinary family whose seven sons (and their neighbors), U.S. merchant mariners all, suddenly found
                themselves squarely in the cross-hairs of the U-boats bearing down on the coastal United States in 1942.
                            From the late 1930s to 1945, virtually all the fuel, food and munitions that sustained the
                Allies in Europe traveled not via the Navy but in merchant ships. After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected
                ships instantly became the U-boats’ prime targets. And they were easy targets—the Navy lacked the
                inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of 1943. Hitler was determined that his
                U-boats should sink every American ship they could find, sometimes within sight of tourist beaches, and
                to kill as many mariners as possible, in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore.
                            As the war progressed, men from Mathews sailed the North and South Atlantic, the Caribbean,
                the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and even the icy Barents Sea in the Arctic
                Circle, where they braved the dreaded Murmansk Run. Through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to
                every danger zone, in every kind of ship. Some died horrific deaths. Others fought to survive torpedo
                explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseys—only
                to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.            The Mathews Men
                shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefields—often the U.S. merchant mariners’ life-and-death
                struggles took place just off the U.S. coast—but also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to
                the Pacific. “When final victory is ours,” General Dwight D. Eisenhower had predicted, “there is no
                organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.” Here, finally, is the
                heroic story of those merchant seamen, recast as the human story of the men from Mathews. ...more

            <description>Thomas Jefferson is often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure—a riddle—a man so riven
                with contradictions that he is almost impossible to know. Lauded as the most articulate voice of
                American freedom and equality, even as he held people—including his own family—in bondage, Jefferson is
                variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of li Thomas Jefferson is
                often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure—a riddle—a man so riven with contradictions that he is
                almost impossible to know. Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as
                he held people—including his own family—in bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an
                atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of limited government who expected all Americans to be farmers
                forever.Now, Annette Gordon-Reed teams up with America's leading Jefferson scholar, Peter S. Onuf, to
                present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clichés that have accrued over
                the years about our third president. Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so
                opaque as to be unknowable, the authors—through their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid
                prose—create a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one "comprised of equal parts
                sun and shadow" (Jane Kamensky).Tracing Jefferson's philosophical development from youth to old age, the
                authors explore what they call the "empire" of Jefferson's imagination—an expansive state of mind born
                of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled
                him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a
                figure of old—"the most blessed of the patriarchs." Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a "patriarch," not
                just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he
                loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of
                extraordinary historical magnitude.Divided into three sections, "Most Blessed of the Patriarchs" reveals
                a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I, "Patriarch," explores Jeffersons's origins in
                Virgina; Part II, " 'Traveller,' " covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, "Enthusiast,"
                delves insightfully into the Virginian's views on Christianity, slavery, and race. We see not just his
                ideas and vision of America but come to know him in an almost familial way, such as through the
                importance of music in his life."Most Blessed of the Patriarchs" fundamentally challenges much of what
                we’ve come to accept about Jefferson, neither hypocrite nor saint, atheist nor fundamentalist.
                Gordon-Reed and Onuf, through a close reading of Jefferson’s own words, reintroduce us all to our most
                influential founding father: a man more gifted than most, but complicated in just the ways we all are.

                historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international
                bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our
                understanding of what it means to be “human.”One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different
                species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the
                others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or
                a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that
                begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving
                humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history
                and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and
                examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead,
                because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed
                life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around
                us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27
                photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to
                spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley,
                Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more

                authors of the  New York Times  bestseller  George Washington’s Secret Six , the little-known story of
                Thomas Jefferson’s battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade – cohost of “Fox
                &amp; Friends” on Fox News and the national radio show “Kilmeade &amp; Friends” – returns with another
                fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. Like their acclaimed bestseller George
                Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important
                episode that has been forgotten by most Americans.   Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration
                in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors,
                among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade
                Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states.  
                The tiny American flotilla—with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navy’s top-of-the-line
                ships—had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the
                USS Philadelphia ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the
                dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded
                the Philadelphia, and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire.   Another amazing
                story is that of William Eaton’s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines
                on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was
                raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.     Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but
                their legacy inspired the opening of the Marine Corps Hymn: “From the halls of Montezuma to the shores
                of Tripoli, we fight our country’s battles in the air, on land, and sea.” Thomas Jefferson and the
                Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors
                some of America’s forgotten heroes.  ...more

                explores the eventful intertwining of outward event and inner intellectual life to tell, in all its
                richness and depth, the story of the 17th century in Europe. It was a time of creativity unparalleled in
                history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher
                and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular)
                languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and
                not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the
                study of the natural world.Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life
                into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science,
                art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer,
                Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of
                perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the
                individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western
                thought for centuries to come. ...more

                J. Bacevich, one of the country’s most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical
                history of this ongoing military enterprise—now more than thirty years old and with no end in sight.
                During the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United
                States initiated a new conflict—a War for the Greater Middle East—that continues to the present day. The
                long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as
                this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian
                Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the
                Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with
                expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like
                “permanent war” and “open-ended war” have become part of everyday discourse. Connecting the dots in a
                way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied
                as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the
                rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what America’s costly military exertions have wrought
                requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying
                the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who
                share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does.
                A twenty-year army veteran who served in Vietnam, Andrew J. Bacevich brings the full weight of his
                expertise to this vitally important subject. America’s War for the Greater Middle East is a bracing
                after-action report from the front lines of history. It will fundamentally change the way we view
                America’s engagement in the world’s most volatile region.Advance praise for America’s War for the
                Greater Middle East“In one arresting book after another, Bacevich has relentlessly laid bare the
                failings of American foreign policy since the Cold War. This one is his sad crowning achievement: the
                story of our long and growing military entanglement in the region of the most tragic, bitter, and
                intractable of conflicts.”—Richard K. Betts, director, Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies,
                Columbia University “An unparalleled historical tour de force certain to affect the formation of future
                U.S. foreign policy . . . Every citizen aspiring to high office needs not only to read but to study and
                learn from this important book. This is one of the most serious and essential books I have read in more
                than half a century of public service.”—Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)
                “Bacevich asks and answers a provocative, inconvenient question: In a multigenerational war in the
                Middle East, ‘Why has the world’s mightiest military achieved so little?’ ”—Graham Allison, director,
                Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at
                Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of GovernmentFrom the Hardcover edition. ...more

                these wings, Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures." - Farel Dalrymple, series creator
                From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple's acclaimed comic book series Pop
                Gun War, this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple's vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York, his
                stories follow characters with wings, talking fish, giants, dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances
                and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair, who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed,
                disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair, a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased,
                sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister, a singer in a rock band, is an
                inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths
                pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink
                style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for
                the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely
                affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The
                story meanders a bit, and it's not always clear where it's headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its
                vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut, reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line, with which it
                should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more

                a cultural savior. The latchkey child of a busy single mother, he’s grown up to be a resentful slacker
                whose idea of high culture is getting stoned and admiring the graffiti in the alley where he scores his
                weed.   His mother, however, is not your average working parent. She’s the head of a secret organization
                called Art Ops, whose mission is protecting the artistic treasures of the world—which have a lot more
                life in them than a casual observer might realize.   Reggie has always shunned his mom’s high-culture
                scene, but a devastating encounter with the shadowy forces menacing the world’s masterpieces has left
                him with a permanent expression of the chaotic power of art flowing through his very veins.   So when
                Art Ops itself suddenly vanishes without a trace, leaving its final rescue—La Gioconda, the Mona Lisa
                herself—out in the cold, it’s up to Reggie and his motley crew—including a masked super-powered
                operative who writes sitcom scripts on spec, a girls-just-wanna-have-fun ’80s music-video icon, and a
                suburban clerk from a mall-punk clothing chain—to come to the rescue.   But do they have what it takes
                to stand up to the dark side of human creativity?   From writer Shaun Simon (co-author of The True Lives
                of the Fabulous Killjoys with My Chemical Romance’s Gerard Way) and artists Michael Allred (co-creator
                of iZOMBIE) and Matt Brundage (The Spirit: The New Adventures) comes ART OPS VOL. 1: HOW TO START A

            <description>In 1916, Dream is captured and encased in a glass globe in a failed attempt by a fictional
                Edwardian magician (very much in the vein of Aleister Crowley) named Roderick Burgess to bind Death and
                attain immortality. Dream bides his time for decades until Burgess dies. Afterwards, his son Alexander
                becomes Dream's new captor. Finally, in 1988, Alex's guards grow careless and In 1916, Dream is captured
                and encased in a glass globe in a failed attempt by a fictional Edwardian magician (very much in the
                vein of Aleister Crowley) named Roderick Burgess to bind Death and attain immortality. Dream bides his
                time for decades until Burgess dies. Afterwards, his son Alexander becomes Dream's new captor. Finally,
                in 1988, Alex's guards grow careless and the guards watching him fall asleep in his presence, allowing
                Dream to use the sand from their dream to his benefit. When the guards awake and break the seal Dream
                was in, he is then able to escape. Dream punishes Alex by cursing him to experience an unending series
                of nightmares. The rest of the story concerns Dream's quest to recover his totems of power, which were
                dispersed following his capture: a pouch of sand, a helm and a ruby. The pouch is being kept by a former
                girlfriend of John Constantine's. Once that is recovered, Dream travels to hell to regain the helm from
                a demon, where he incurs the wrath of Lucifer (an enmity that will have major repercussions later in the
                series). The ruby is in the possession of John Dee, a.k.a. Doctor Destiny, a supervillain from the
                Justice League of America series. He has warped and corrupted the ruby, rendering Dream unable to use
                it, and with it he nearly tears apart the Dreaming. However, thinking that it will kill Dream, Dee
                shatters the ruby, inadvertently releasing the power that Dream had stored in the ruby and restoring
                Dream to his full power. The collection ends with "The Sound of Her Wings", an epilogue to the first
                story-arc. This issue introduces a character who has become one of the series' most popular and
                prominent personalities: Dream's older sister Death. She is depicted as an attractive, down-to-earth
                young goth girl, very unlike the traditional personification of death, and spends the issue talking
                Dream out of his brief post-quest depression. ...more

                all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially—statistically speaking—there aren't any

                strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in
                great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius."—-from the
                IntroductionArt &amp; Fear explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and
                the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way. The book's
                co-authors, David Bayles and Ted Orland, are themselves both working artists, grappling daily with the
                problems of making art in the real world. Their insights and observations, drawn from personal
                experience, provide an incisive view into the world of art as it is expeienced by artmakers
                themselves.This is not your typical self-help book. This is a book written by artists, for artists -—
                it's about what it feels like when artists sit down at their easel or keyboard, in their studio or
                performance space, trying to do the work they need to do. First published in 1994, Art &amp; Fear
                quickly became an underground classic. Word-of-mouth response alone—now enhanced by internet posting—has
                placed it among the best-selling books on artmaking and creativity nationally.Art &amp; Fear has
                attracted a remarkably diverse audience, ranging from beginning to accomplished artists in every medium,
                and including an exceptional concentration among students and teachers. The original Capra Press edition
                of Art &amp; Fear sold 80,000 copies.An excerpt:Today, more than it was however many years ago, art is
                hard because you have to keep after it so consistently. On so many different fronts. For so little

                Faith Salie, of NPR's Wait Wait…Don't Tell Me! and CBS News Sunday Morning, a collection of daring,
                funny essays chronicling the author's adventures during her lifelong quest for approval   Faith Salie
                has done it all in the name of validation. Whether it’s trying to impress her parents with a perfect
                GPA, undergoing an exorsism in the hopes of saving her toxic marriage, or maintaining the BMI of “a
                flapper with a touch of dysentery,” Salie is the ultimate approval seeker—an “approval junkie,” if you
                will. In “Miss Aphrodite,” she recounts her strategy for winning the high school beauty pageant. (“Not
                to brag or anything, but no one stood a chance against my emaciated, spastic resolve.”) “What I Wore to
                My Divorce” describes Salie’s struggle to pick the perfect outfit to wear to the courthouse to divorce
                her “wasband.” (“I envisioned a look that said, ‘Yo, THIS is what you’ll be missing…even though you’ve
                introduced your new girlfriend to our mutual friends, and she’s a decade younger than I am and is also a
                fit model.”) In "Ovary Achiever," she shares tips on how to ace your egg retrieval. (“Thank your
                fertility doctor when she announces you have ‘amazing ovaries.’ Try to be humble about it [‘Oh,these old
                things?’].”) And in “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me About Batman’s Nipples” she reveals the secrets
                behind Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me! (“I study for this show like Tracy Flick on Adderall”). With thoughtful
                irreverence, Salie reflects on why she tries so hard to please others, and herself, highlighting a
                phenomenon that many people—especially women—experience at home and in the workplace. Equal parts
                laugh-out loud funny and poignant, Approval Junkie is one woman’s journey to realizing that seeking
                approval from others is more than just getting them to like you—it's challenging yourself to achieve,
                and survive, more than you ever thought you could. ...more

                Award-winning author of Just Kids: an unforgettable odyssey into the mind of this legendary artist, told
                through the prism of cafés and haunts she has visited and worked in around the world.M Train is a
                journey through eighteen "stations." It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village café where Smith goes every
                morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her
                notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and
                present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in
                Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in
                New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath,
                Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation,
                alongside signature memories including her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic
                Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we
                might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning
                black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself. M Train is a meditation on endings and on beginnings:
                a poetic tour de force by one of the most brilliant multiplatform artists at work today. ...more

                terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A
                Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of
                staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of "Rules and
                Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book," and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special
                mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully
                labeled "Here is a drawing of a stapler:"). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became
                both an orphan and a "single mother" when his parents died within five months of one another of
                unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of
                his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports
                equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting
                babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's
                upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his
                idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less
                successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X
                way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and
                he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and
                his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then,
                Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G.
                already. "The book thereafter is kind of uneven," he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and
                while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this
                self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a
                writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the
                footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David
                Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in
                history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him.
                What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way
                available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its
                concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park

                sugar-fiend of a German grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a
                flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on
                anything: not about food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. G On one side,
                there is Grace: prize-winning author Diana Abu-Jaber’s tough, independent sugar-fiend of a German
                grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a flamboyant,
                spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on anything: not about
                food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. Grace warned her away from children.
                Bud wanted her married above all—even if he had to provide the ring. Caught between cultures and
                lavished with contradictory “advice” from both sides of her family, Diana spent years learning how to
                ignore others’ well-intentioned prescriptions.Hilarious, gorgeously written, poignant, and wise, Life
                Without a Recipe is Diana’s celebration of journeying without a map, of learning to ignore the script
                and improvise, of escaping family and making family on one’s own terms. As Diana discovers, however,
                building confidence in one’s own path sometimes takes a mistaken marriage or two—or in her case, three:
                to a longhaired boy-poet, to a dashing deconstructionist literary scholar, and finally to her steadfast,
                outdoors-loving Scott. It also takes a good deal of angst (was it possible to have a serious writing
                career and be a mother?) and, even when she knew what she wanted (the craziest thing, in one’s late
                forties: a baby!), the nerve to pursue it.Finally, fearlessly independent like the Grace she’s named
                after, Diana and Scott’s daughter Gracie will heal all the old battles with Bud and, like her
                writer-mom, learn to cook up a life without a recipe. ...more

                Maggie Nelson's The Argonauts is a genre-bending memoir, a work of "autotheory" offering fresh, fierce,
                and timely thinking about desire, identity, and the limitations and possibilities of love and language.

                identity, and the limitations and possibilities of love and language. At its center is a romance: the
                story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's
                account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a
                pregnancy, offers a firsthand account of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making.Writing in
                the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal
                experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the
                vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and
                the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.

                that’s her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June
                can only be herself in Finn’s company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies,
                far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June’s world is turned upside
                down. But Finn’s death brings a surprise acquaintance into June’s life - someone who will help her to
                heal and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.At Finn’s
                funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a
                package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn’s apartment and a note from
                Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June
                realizes she’s not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected
                friend, he just might be the one she needs the most.An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, Tell the
                Wolves I’m Home is a tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way
                compassion can make us whole again. ...more

                cast-iron skillet, and his laptop and moved to Paris. In that time, the culinary culture of France has

                techniques from around the world into traditional French dishes.      In My Paris Kitchen, David
                remasters the classics, introduces lesser-known fare, and presents 100 sweet and savory recipes that
                reflect the way modern Parisians eat today. You’ll find Soupe à l’oignon, Cassoulet, Coq au vin, and
                Croque-monsieur, as well as Smoky barbecue-style pork, Lamb shank tagine, Dukkah-roasted cauliflower,
                Salt cod fritters with tartar sauce, and Wheat berry salad with radicchio, root vegetables, and
                pomegranate. And of course, there’s dessert: Warm chocolate cake with salted butter caramel sauce, Duck
                fat cookies, Bay leaf poundcake with orange glaze, French cheesecake...and the list goes on. David also

                tonight, for friends or just for the kids, with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of flavor. She makes it
                all look easy, because it is. Everyday Italian is true to its title: the fresh, simple recipes are
                incredibly quick and accessible, and also utterly mouth-watering—perfect for everyday cooking. And the
                book is focused on the real-life considerations of what you actually have in your refrigerator and
                pantry (no mail-order ingredients here) and what you’re in the mood for—whether a simply sauced pasta or
                a hearty family-friendly roast, these great recipes cover every contingency. So, for example, you’ll
                find dishes that you can make solely from pantry ingredients, or those that transform lowly leftovers
                into exquisite entrées (including brilliant ideas for leftover pasta), and those that satisfy your
                yearning to have something sweet baking in the oven. There are 7 ways to make red sauce more

                prosciutto, 3 variations on basic polenta, 2 great steaks, and 1 sublime chocolate tiramisù—plus 100
                other recipes that turn everyday ingredients into speedy but special dinners.What’s more, Everyday
                Italian is organized according to what type of food you want tonight—whether a soul-warming stew for
                Sunday supper, a quick sauté for a weeknight, or a baked pasta for potluck. These categories will help
                you figure out what to cook in an instant, with such choices as fresh-from-the-pantry appetizers,
                sauceless pastas, everyday roasts, and stuffed vegetables—whatever you’re in the mood for, you’ll be
                able to find a simple, delicious recipe for it here. That’s the beauty of Italian home cooking, and
                that’s what Giada De Laurentiis offers here—the essential recipes to make a great Italian dinner.

                Pépin’s The Apprentice and Marcus Samuelsson’s Yes, Chef, here is the coming-of-age story of a true
                French chef and international culinary icon. Before he earned three Michelin stars at Le Bernardin, won

                Chef, and even before he knew how to make a proper omelet, Eric Ripert was a young boy in the South of
                France who felt that his world had come to an end. The only place Eric felt at home was in the kitchen.

                In this book, she shows us how to make cooking part of a stylish life Though she is best known as a
                supermodel and Sports Illustrated swimsuit covergirl, all Chrissy Teigen really wants to do is talk
                about dinner—the good, the greasy, the good-for-you, and the goof-ups. Stylish but brash, witty and
                big-hearted, Chrissy cooks beautifully, but with the spirit of the amateur. In this book, she shows us
                how to make cooking part of a stylish lifestyle and how to look good doing it…or at least how to laugh
                at ourselves if we don’t.“The thing that makes me happiest isn’t when people stop me in the street to
                say they saw me in a magazine, but when they say they were inspired to cook because of what I posted on
                Instagram,” Chrissy Teigen says. Despite being a professional Beautiful Person, Teigen took cooking
                classes, runs a popular food blog, and loves connecting her fans with food through her widely followed
                Twitter and Instagram accounts. In this book, she brings her passion for cooking to the forefront.
                Through 100 recipes that range from her mom’s Thai classics to her own creations and dishes taught to
                her by her chef friends, Chrissy will show us how easy it can be to make cooking accessible and fun.

                restaurant owner—she’s never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at
                first, for special occasions—and, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. D The long-awaited
                cookbook by Deb Perelman of Smitten Kitchen—home cook, mom, photographer, and celebrated food
                blogger.Deb Perelman loves to cook. It’s as simple as that. She isn’t a chef or a restaurant owner—she’s
                never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special
                occasions—and, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number
                of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? You’ll get
                more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe that’s
                downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking
                should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor can—and should be—delicious...every time. Deb
                is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding
                the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cook—the ones with little time to spare, little
                money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same
                warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbook—more than 100
                new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Deb’s
                beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home
                cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will
                answer all questions: “What should my new signature dessert be?” “What is always welcome at a potluck?”
                “What did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?” These are the recipes you
                bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her
                new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time.
                Deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep in—plus what to make for it!—and the essential items
                you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to
                savory tarts and pizzas; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Pancetta, White Bean and Swiss Chard Pot Pies;
                from Buttered Popcorn Cookies to Chocolate Hazelnut Layer Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday
                night, or your most special occasion. ...more

                than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As

                the fall of 2009, the food world was rocked when Gourmet magazine was abruptly shuttered by its parent
                company. No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief,
                Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had
                seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. “I did what I
                always do when I’m confused, lonely, or frightened,” she writes. “I disappeared into the kitchen.”My
                Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons—and Reichl’s emotions—as she slowly heals through the simple
                pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would “throw quick meals together” for her family and
                friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and
                inviting, sautéed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters
                chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course
                of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy
                again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a life’s passion for food: a
                blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that
                accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of
                spring. Here, too, is Reichl’s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary
                supporters and lively confidants. Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My
                Kitchen Year may be Ruth Reichl’s most stirring book yet—one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side
                of the world's most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again
                and again. ...more

                day and working out 90 minutes a day, six times a week. When his excess fat started causing brain fog

                Asprey was a successful Silicon Valley multimillionaire. He also weighed 300 pounds, despite the fact
                that he was doing what doctors recommended: eating 1,800 calories a day and working out 90 minutes a
                day, six times a week. When his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy
                and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to "hack" his own
                biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy,
                performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in
                Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he
                explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result?
                The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak
                performance. The Bulletproof Diet will challenge—and change—the way you think about weight loss and
                wellness. You will skip breakfast, stop counting calories, eat high levels of healthy saturated fat,
                work out and sleep less, and add smart supplements.In doing so, you'll gain energy, build lean muscle,
                and watch the pounds melt off. By ditching traditional "diet" thinking, Asprey went from being
                overweight and sick in his twenties to maintaining a 100-pound weight loss, increasing his IQ, and
                feeling better than ever in his forties. The Bulletproof Diet is your blueprint to a better life.

                friendship, and the power of unexpected connections…Annabel Ford has everything under control, devoting
                her time to her twin five-year-old boys and to keeping her household running seamlessly. So when her

                connect, something has to give.On the surface, these three women may not have much in common. Yet when
                their lives are thrust together and unlikely friendships are formed—at a time when they all need someone
                to lean on—Annabel, Piper, and Mackenzie band together to help each navigate their new realities.

                point in this vivid book. We love vinyl records because they combine the tactile, the visual, the
                seeable effects of age and care and carelessless. When he searches for the records he lost and
                sold, Spitznagel is trying to return to a tangible past, and he details that process with great
                sensitivity and impact."—Dave Eggers, author of The CircleHigh Fidelity meets Killing Yourself to Live
                in this memoir of one man's search for his lost record collection. As he finds himself within spitting
                distance of middle-age, journalist Eric Spitznagel feels acutely the loss of…something. Freedom? Maybe.
                Coolness? Could be. The records he sold in a financial pinch? Definitely. To find out for sure, he sets
                out on a quest to find  the original vinyl artifacts from his past. Not just copies. The exact same
                records: The Bon Jovi record with his first girlfriend's phone number scrawled on the front sleeve.
                The KISS Alive II he once shared with his little brother. The Replacements Let It Be he’s pretty sure,
                20 years later, would still smell like weed. As he embarks on his hero's journey, he reminisces about
                the actual records, the music, and the people he listened to it with—old girlfriends, his high school
                pals, and, most poignantly, his father and his young son. He explores the magic of music and memory as
                he interweaves his adventures in record- culture with questions about our connection to our past,
                whether we can ever recapture it, and whether we would want to if we could. ...more

                artist does not create art as an end in itself. He creates art for human beings. Humanity is the
                goal.”—Bronislaw HubermanAt fourteen, Bronislaw Huberman played the Brahms Violin The compelling
                biography of the violinist who founded the Palestine Symphony Orchestra and saved hundreds of people
                from Hitler—as seen in Josh Aronson’s documentary Orchestra of Exiles.“The true artist does not create
                art as an end in itself. He creates art for human beings. Humanity is the goal.”—Bronislaw HubermanAt
                fourteen, Bronislaw Huberman played the Brahms Violin Concerto in Vienna— winning high praise from the
                composer himself, who was there. Instantly famous, Huberman began touring all over the world and
                received invitations to play for royalty across Europe. But after witnessing the tragedy of World War I,
                he committed his phenomenal talent and celebrity to aid humanity.After studying at the Sorbonne in
                Paris, Huberman joined the ranks of Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein in calling for peace through the
                Pan European Movement. But when hope for their noble vision was destroyed by the rise of Nazism,
                Huberman began a crusade that would become his greatest legacy—the creation, in 1936, of the Palestine
                Symphony, which twelve years later became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.In creating this world-level
                orchestra, Huberman miraculously arranged for the very best Jewish musicians and their families to
                emigrate from Nazi-threatened territories. His tireless campaigning for the project—including a marathon
                fundraising concert tour across America—ultimately saved nearly a thousand Jews from the approaching
                Holocaust. Inviting the great Arturo Toscanini to conduct the orchestra’s first concert, Huberman’s
                clarion call of art over cruelty was heard around the world. His story contains estraordinary
                adventures, riches and royalty, politicians and broken promises, losses and triumphs. Against near
                impossible obstacles, Huberman refused to give up on his dream to create a unique and life-saving
                orchestra of exiles which was one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century.Includes

            <description>With the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards created the riffs, the lyrics and the songs that roused
                the world, and over four decades he lived the original rock and roll life. Now, at last, the man himself
                tells us the story of life in the crossfire hurricane.

            <description>In this stunning memoir, Rob Sheffield, a veteran rock and pop culture critic and staff writer
                for Rolling Stone magazine, tells the story of his musical coming of age, and how rock music, the first
                love of his life, led him to his second, a girl named Renee. Rob and Renee's life together - they wed
                after graduate school, both became music journalists, and were married onl In this stunning memoir, Rob
                Sheffield, a veteran rock and pop culture critic and staff writer for Rolling Stone magazine, tells the
                story of his musical coming of age, and how rock music, the first love of his life, led him to his
                second, a girl named Renee. Rob and Renee's life together - they wed after graduate school, both became
                music journalists, and were married only five years when Renee died suddenly on Mother's Day, 1997 - is
                shared through the window of the mix tapes they obsessively compiled. There are mixes to court each
                other, mixes for road trips, mixes for doing the dishes, mixes for sleeping - and, eventually, mixes to
                mourn Rob's greatest loss. The tunes were among the great musical output of the early 1990s - Pearl Jam,
                Nirvana, Pavement, Yo La Tengo, REM, Weezer - as well as classics by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles,
                Aretha Franklin and more. Mixing the skilful, tragic punch of Dave Eggers and the romantic honesty of
                Nick Hornby, LOVE IS A MIX TAPE is a story of lost love and the kick-you-in-the-gut energy of great pop
                music. ...more

                evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find
                only one of the children. He is gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers and
                unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a
                detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a 12-year-old girl is found

                King's Abbot, a widow's sudden suicide sparks rumors that she murdered her first husband, was being
                blackmailed, and was carrying on a secret affair with the wealthy Roger Ackroyd. The following evening,
                Ackroyd is murdered in his locked study--but not before receiving a letter identifying the widow's
                blackmailer. King's Abbot is crawling with suspects, including a nervous butler, Ackroyd's wayward
                stepson, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, who has taken up residence in the victim's home.
                It's now up to the famous detective Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King's Abbot to garden, to solve
                the case of who killed Roger Ackroyd--a task in which he is aided by the village doctor and narrator,
                James Sheppard, and by Sheppard's ingenious sister, Caroline.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the book
                that made Agatha Christie a household name and launched her career as a perennial bestseller. Originally
                published in 1926, it is a landmark in the mystery genre. It was in the vanguard of a new class of
                popular detective fiction that ushered in the modern era of mystery novels. ...more

                discovery of the body of a prominent local oilman, Morgan pursues a quest for justice that puts his
                reputation, career, and life at risk. A journey that takes him into the dark shadows of the sex-for-sale

                a meditation on the self-perpetuating nature of injustice and the ethereal nature of justice itself.

                Eugenides  ﻿Written in his distinctively dazzling manner, Oscar Wilde’s story of a fashionable young man
                who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty is the author’s most popular work. The tale of Dorian
                Gray’s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it ﬁrst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was
                attacked for the novel’s corrupting inﬂuence, he responded that there is, in fact, “a terrible moral in
                Dorian Gray.” Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became
                issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde’s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of
                Dorian Gray’s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, “Basil Hallward is what I think I
                am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.” ...more

                Northern epic of a hero’s triumphs as a young warrior and his fated death as a defender of his people.
                The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on, physically and
                psychically exposed in the exhausted aftermath. It is not hard to draw parallels in this story to the
                historical curve of consciousness in the twentieth century, but the poem also transcends such
                considerations, telling us psychological and spiritual truths that are permanent and liberating.Beowulf
                is considered to have been composed between the 8th and the early 11th century. According to Wikipedia,

            <description>Tired of their servitude to man, a group of farm animals revolt and establish their own
                society, only to be betrayed into worse servitude by their leaders, the pigs, whose slogan becomes: "All
                animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." This 1945 satire addresses the
                socialist/communist philosophy of Stalin in the Soviet Union.

                warning foretelling the fall of the Monarchy in this modern fairytale. In the center of the verdant
                Monarchy lies Dreadwillow Carse, a black and desolate bog that the happy people of the land do their
                best to ignore. Little is known about it, except for one dire warning: If any monarc A princess and a
                peasant girl must embark on a dangerous quest to outwit a centuries-old warning foretelling the fall of
                the Monarchy in this modern fairytale.   In the center of the verdant Monarchy lies Dreadwillow Carse, a
                black and desolate bog that the happy people of the land do their best to ignore. Little is known about
                it, except for one dire warning: If any monarch enters Dreadwillow Carse, then the Monarchy will
                fall. Twelve-year-old Princess Jeniah yearns to know what the marsh could possibly conceal that might
                topple her family’s thousand-year reign of peace and prosperity. Meanwhile, in the nearby town of
                Emberfell, where everyone lives with unending joy, a girl named Aon hides a sorrow she can never reveal.
                She knows that something in the carse--something that sings a haunting tune only Aon can hear--holds the
                cure for her sadness. Yet no matter how many times she tries to enter, the terror-inducing dreadwillow
                trees keep her away. After a chance meeting, Princess Jeniah and Aon hatch a plan to send Aon into the
                heart of the carse to unlock its darkest secret. But when Aon doesn’t return, a guilt-stricken Jeniah
                must enter the carse to try and rescue her friend--even if it means risking the entire Monarchy. ...more

                finds that while Taoism is known for its quiet, enigmatic wisdom, the Tao can also have the cleansing
                force of a rushing river.Through his interpretation of this ancient Chinese text, Martin elucidates
                revolutionary messages condemning power-seeking and greed. He emphasizes that humans have a “natural
                virtue” that can help them heal the planet; shows how Taoism’s simplicity can be subversive and its
                flexibility a potent force; and reassures that “when injustice is the rule, justice always lies in
                wait.”Provocative and stirring, Martin’s Tao flows within and through those who ride the waves of anger
                and frustration and gently guides them to true freedom.“We have learned the secret of transformation:

                and joy of a life lived ?in the now.? In "A New Earth," Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show
                how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but
                also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment
                to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how
                to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence. "The
                Power of Now" was a question-and-answer handbook. "A New Earth" has been written as a traditional
                narrative, offering anecdotes and philosophies in a way that is accessible to all. Illuminating,
                enlightening, and uplifting, "A New Earth" is a profoundly spiritual manifesto for a better way of
                life?and for building a better world. ...more

                heaven themselves—and live a more meaningful life.On December 10, 2009, Crystal McVea was being treated

                Times bestseller, Waking Up in Heaven, comes an extraordinary story about Crystal McVea’s personal
                transformation after visiting heaven and how readers can experience heaven themselves—and live a more
                meaningful life.On December 10, 2009, Crystal McVea was being treated in a hospital for pancreatitis.
                Her heart stopped pumping for nine minutes before doctors managed to revive her. In those nine minutes,
                she went to heaven, stood with God, and was forever changed.Ever since Crystal’s incredible experience,
                her life has been profoundly different. She has become a brand new person in every conceivable
                way—heart, mind, soul, and spirit. By dying, Crystal learned how to live. Crystal realized that heaven
                is real and our true home, but we are still meant to have meaningful lives full of passion and purpose
                right here on earth. She believes we have to chase heaven while we are still alive and allow God to turn
                our lukewarm love into a firestorm of faith. Chasing Heaven is the story of how God called to Crystal,
                what He told her, and how she found a way to get closer to Him again here on earth.Crystal assures us
                that we don’t have to die and go to heaven in order to ignite our faith. We also don’t have to abandon
                the lives we have in order to experience God and heaven. Chasing Heaven is about following the path to
                the Lord, and discovering your spiritual destiny.The journey that followed Crystal’s time in heaven has
                been difficult, complicated, and surprising—full of twists and turns, setbacks and triumphs, drama and
                comedy, and everything that makes life so messy and beautiful. ...more

                other challenges 20-somethings face in a laugh-out-loud collection of poetry.Samantha Jayne knows that
                life post-college isn't as glamorous as all undergrads think it's going to be... because she's currently
                living it. A graphic artist, Sam started creating doodles and funny poems about her life as a
                25-year-old. And when she decided to put them on Instagram, the captions were full of other people
                tagging friends and saying, "This is literally us." At a time where it seems like everyone around you is
                getting married, making more money than you do, and paying off their student loans, Sam's poetry
                captures the voice of millennials everywhere who know that being in your 20s can sometimes be the exact
                opposite of "the best years of your life." ...more

                last book in the "Teen Ink" series" Written in the Dirt "was published. Now, a whole new batch of teen
                writers has emerged with their own unique voices. "Leave This Song Behind" features the best poetry
                submitted by those writers to "Teen Ink" over the last five years. The pieces in this book were chosen
                because they were so powerful that they stood out from the rest. "Teen Ink" editors took a deep look
                into each poem's strengths then divided "Leave This Song Behind" into seven sections based on the poetic
                techniques or qualities that moved them most. Vivid sensory details made some poems shine; others caught
                their attention with simple, sparse language. Still others were chosen because of their thoughtful use
                of form; compelling stories; strong figurative language; unexpected connections and wit; and fresh
                writing about familiar topics.Dig in and let these brave young voices capture your heart and mind with

            <description>More than thirty-five years ago, when the weather allowed, Wendell Berry began spending his
                sabbaths outdoors, walking and wandering around familiar territory, seeking a deep intimacy only time
                could provide. These walks arranged themselves into poems and each year since he has completed a

                walking and wandering around familiar territory, seeking a deep intimacy only time could provide. These
                walks arranged themselves into poems and each year since he has completed a sequence dated by the year
                of its composition. Last year we collected the lot into a collection, This Day, the Sabbath Poems
                1979-2013. This new sequence for the following year is one of the richest yet. This group provides a
                virtual syllabus for all of Mr. Berry’s cultural and agricultural work in concentrated form. Many of
                these poems are drawn from the view from a small porch in the woods, a place of stillness and
                reflection, a vantage point “of the one/life of the forest composed/of uncountable lives in
                countless/years each life coherent itself within/ the coherence, the great composure,/of all.” A new
                collection of Wendell Berry poems is always an occasion of joyful celebration and this one is especially
                so. ...more

                to their very end: everything that’s buried by snow, dirt, and ash, just like everything that’s buried
                by politics, homophobia, sexism, racism, religion; and history is resurrected, demanding to be heard and
                addressed.In Woodcock’s poetry, how we deal with what resurfaces is the key. What do those who suffer
                really mean to those who have abandoned them to small, conscience-soothing charitable donations or the
                occasional tweet? How can the poet, or anyone else, sleep at night knowing homosexuals are being thrown
                off building tops, after one steps into a hole and finds an abandoned corpse in an Azeri cemetery, or
                after the elders of an Aboriginal community are left helpless against those who only want to exploit
                them? Still, You can’t bury them all demonstrates that the world is not just the horrific place the
                media often portrays. In each of the worlds he touches, Woodcock discovers a spirit and strength to
                celebrate. ...more

                Magazine "In Aracelis Girmay we have a poet who collects, polishes, and shares stories with such
                brilliant invention, tenderness, and intellectual liveliness that it is understandabl Praise for
                Aracelis Girmay:"[Girmay's] every loss—she calls them estrangements—is a yearning for connection across
                time and place; her every fragment is a bulwark against ruin." — O, The Oprah Magazine "In Aracelis
                Girmay we have a poet who collects, polishes, and shares stories with such brilliant invention,
                tenderness, and intellectual liveliness that it is understandable that we think of her as the blessed
                curator of our collective histories. There is in her art the vulnerability of one who lives inside of
                the stories that she gathers in this remarkable collection. Her poems set off alarms even as they
                transform the world she inhabits, showing us, in the process, exactly what she asks of Romare Bearden’s
                art: ‘…how not to // assign all blackness near the sea / a captivity.’ This is one of the many sweet
                contradictions in the black maria, which ‘is a black flag / wounding the pastoral.’ I am deeply thankful
                that we have a poet of her unique and singular talent writing today." —Kwame DawesTaking its name from
                the moon's dark plains, misidentified as seas by early astronomers, the black maria investigates African
                diasporic histories, the consequences of racism within American culture, and the question of human
                identity. Central to this project is a desire to recognize the lives of Eritrean refugees who have been
                made invisible by years of immigration crisis, refugee status, exile, and resulting statelessness. The
                recipient of a 2015 Whiting Award for Poetry, Girmay's newest collection elegizes and celebrates life,
                while wrestling with the humanistic notion of seeing beyond: seeing violence, seeing grace, and seeing
                each other better."to the sea"great storage house, historyon which we rode, we touchedthe brief pulse of

                Collapse enters the landscape of personal narrative in an attempt to reconcile life’s little universal
                griefs.Slow States of Collapse presents a world that is at once menacing and full of wonder and grace.
                It’s a poetry of “casual cruelty” and “kisses like / puncture wounds,” of “something too tender to
                touch” and “the threat of an intense beauty.” In this collection, illness confronts bedside manners
                while a migrant restlessness also paints remarkable portraits of shifting self-image, and in the process
                the nature of personal and political power is reimagined. ...more

                may be an NHL star, but he’s a country boy at heart. His ultimate fantasy is going home with the Stanley

                hoping to enjoy a night out with his teammates, he ends up hitting it off with a down-to-earth waitress
                who’s a complete breath of fresh air—until Duncan learns that she’s a part-time model. He tries to

                Foster has spent far more time in her cleats than between the sheets. For 21 years, her Friday nights
                have consisted of blocking shots rather than taking them. But now that she's landed in Rio, she's ready
                to see for herself if the rumors about the Olympic Village are true:• The athletes are all sex-crazed
                maniacs... • The committee passes out condoms like candy... • The games continue long after the medals
                have been handed out... As Andie walks the line between rumor and reality, she's forced into the path of
                Frederick Archibald, a decorated Olympic swimmer and owner of a sexy British accent--too bad he's
                unavailable in a way that "it's complicated" doesn't even begin to explain.In other words: off limits.It
                doesn't matter that he has abs that could bring peace to the Middle East and a smile that makes even the
                Queen blush; Andie fully intends on keeping her focus on the soccer field. But the Village is small.
                Suffocating. Everywhere Andie goes, Freddie happens to be there--shirtless, wet from the pool, and
                determined to show her a whole new meaning of the phrase "international affairs".Due to strong language
                and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18. ...more

                PRIZEFrom the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the beautiful, stunningly
                ambitious instant New York Times bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths
                collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.Marie-Laure lives with
                her father in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where he works as the master of its thousands of
                locks. When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their
                neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. When she is twelve, the Nazis
                occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s
                reclusive great-uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s
                most valuable and dangerous jewel.In a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up with his
                younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing
                these crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then
                a special assignment to track the resistance. More and more aware of the human cost of his intelligence,
                Werner travels through the heart of the war and, finally, into Saint-Malo, where his story and
                Marie-Laure’s converge.Doerr’s “stunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors” (San Francisco
                Chronicle) are dazzling. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, he illuminates the
                ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, a National Book
                Award finalist, All the Light We Cannot See is a magnificent, deeply moving novel from a writer “whose

            <description>The publication of Darwin’s The Origin of Species in 1859 marked a dramatic turning point in

                The Origin of Species in 1859 marked a dramatic turning point in scientific thought. The volume had
                taken Darwin more than twenty years to publish, in part because he envisioned the storm of controversy
                it was certain to unleash. Indeed, selling out its first edition on its first day, The Origin of Species
                revolutionized science, philosophy, and theology.Darwin’s reasoned, documented arguments carefully
                advance his theory of natural selection and his assertion that species were not created all at once by a
                divine hand but started with a few simple forms that mutated and adapted over time. Whether commenting
                on his own poor health, discussing his experiments to test instinct in bees, or relating a conversation
                about a South American burrowing rodent, Darwin’s monumental achievement is surprisingly personal and
                delightfully readable. Its profound ideas remain controversial even today, making it the most
                influential book in the natural sciences ever written—an important work not just to its time but to the
                history of humankind. ...more

                of the world’s leading physicists and author the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Elegant Universe, comes a
                grand tour of the universe that makes us look at reality in a completely different way.Space and time
                form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an
                entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel
                to the past? Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive, mathematical concepts
                like String Theory, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies
                drawn from common experience. From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to
                Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant
                objects can instantaneously coordinate their behavior, Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific
                backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics
                has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world. ...more

            <description>Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare
                distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as
                within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have
                forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationall Richard Dawkins'
                brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked
                as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped
                change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink
                their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene,
                Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves
                around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent
                altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive,
                and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This 30th anniversary edition
                of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters
                added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after
                the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword
                by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific
                community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary
                thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights,
                and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today. ...more

                bestselling author Sam Kean comes incredible stories of science, history, finance, mythology, the arts,
                medicine, and more, as told by the Periodic Table. Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I, 53)? How did radium

                laboratory pranksters?*The Periodic Table is a crowning scientific achievement, but it's also a treasure
                trove of adventure, betrayal, and obsession. These fascinating tales follow every element on the table
                as they play out their parts in human history, and in the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who
                discovered them. THE DISAPPEARING SPOON masterfully fuses science with the classic lore of invention,
                investigation, and discovery--from the Big Bang through the end of time. *Though solid at room
                temperature, gallium is a moldable metal that melts at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. A classic science prank is
                to mold gallium spoons, serve them with tea, and watch guests recoil as their utensils disappear.

            <description>Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick
                hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into
                adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm
                stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of h Renowned
                ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already
                carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a
                few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from
                copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is
                surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon
                afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four
                weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in
                general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the
                oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the
                nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital
                role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead
                uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and
                scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific
                knowledge of reproduction. ...more

                struggle just to keep our heads above water. To save the American Dream, we’re told that we need to

                the American Dream is vanishing, and that the cause is rising income inequality. The rich are getting
                richer by rigging the system in their favor, leaving the rest of us to struggle just to keep our heads
                above water. To save the American Dream, we’re told that we need to fight inequality through tax hikes,
                wealth redistribution schemes, and a far higher minimum wage.But what if that narrative is wrong? What
                if the real threat to the American Dream isn’t rising income inequality—but an all-out war on success?In
                Equal is Unfair, a timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost
                everything we’ve been taught about inequality is wrong. You’ll discover:• why successful CEOs make so
                much money—and deserve to• how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help• why
                middle-class stagnation is a myth• how the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced
                equality• the disturbing philosophy behind Obama’s economic agenda.The critics of inequality are right
                about one thing: the American Dream is under attack. But instead of fighting to make America a place
                where anyone can achieve success, they are fighting to tear down those who already have. The real key to
                making America a freer, fairer, more prosperous nation is to protect and celebrate the pursuit of
                success—not pull down the high fliers in the name of equality. ...more

                the story of conservatism from the Goldwater 1960s to the present day Tea Party that has resulted in
                broken promises and an ideological purity that drives moderate Republicans away “Dionne's expertise is
                evident in this finely crafted and convincing work.” —The Los Angeles TimesFrom one of our most engaging
                political reporters and the author of Why Americans Hate Politics; the story of conservatism from the
                Goldwater 1960s to the present day Tea Party that has resulted in broken promises and an ideological
                purity that drives moderate Republicans away.Why the Right Went Wrong offers a historical view of the
                right since the 1960s. Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a
                wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwater’s worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The
                radicalism of today’s conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J.
                Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more
                than drive moderates out of the Republican Party—it beat back alternative definitions of
                conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administration—not Nixon not Reagan not two Bushes—could live
                up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years
                ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W.
                Bush, to Newt Gingrich’s revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching
                “compassionate conservatism” and a “Fourth Way” to Clinton’s “Third Way.” Conservatives quickly defined
                him as an advocate of “big government” and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education,
                and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea
                Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party,
                controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a
                country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the
                country’s, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how. ...more

                Miserable, psychologist Randy Paterson outlines 40 specific behaviors and habits, which—if followed—are
                sure to lead to a lifetime of unhappiness. On the other hand, if you do the opposite, you may yet join
                the ranks of happy people everywhere!There are stacks upon stacks of self-help books that will promise
                you love, happiness, and a fabulous life. But how can you pinpoint the exact behaviors that cause you to
                be miserable in the first place? Sometimes when we’re depressed, or just sad or unhappy, our instincts
                tell us to do the opposite of what we should—such as focusing on the negative, dwelling on what we can’t
                change, isolating ourselves from friends and loved ones, eating junk food, or overindulging in alcohol.
                Sound familiar?This tongue-in-cheek guide will help you identify the behaviors that make you unhappy and
                discover how you—and only you—are holding yourself back from a life of contentment. You’ll learn to spot
                the tried-and-true traps that increase feelings of dissatisfaction, foster a lack of motivation, and
                detract from our quality of life—as well as ways to avoid them.So, get ready to live the life you want

                offers up all the gory details of a life permanently in progress. She reassures you that it’s okay to
                not have life completely figured out, even when you reach middle age (and find your first gray pubic
                hair!). She talks about making unusual or unpopular life decisions (such as cultivating a “friend with
                benefits” or not going home for the holidays) because you don’t necessarily want for yourself what
                everyone else seems to think you should. It’s about renting when everyone says you should own, dating
                around when everyone thinks you should settle down, and traveling alone when everyone pities you for
                going to Paris without a man.From marriage to divorce and sex to mental health, I Know What I’m
                Doing—and Other Lies I Tell Myself is about embracing the fact that life is a bit of a sh*t show and
                it’s definitely more than okay to stay true to yourself. ...more

                memoir on its proverbial ear, mining the exceedingly rich terrain of his life, his family, and his
                unique worldview—a sensibility at once take-no-prisoners sharp and deeply charitable. A tart-tongued
                mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers;
                a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family
                gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice,
                without doubt one of the freshest in American writing. ...more

                Two straight-A students head off to school, and when only one of them returns home Chesney Yelverton is
                coaxed from retirement and assigned to what proves to be the most difficult and deadly - case of his
                career. From the shining notorious East Side, When You Are Engulfed in Flames confirms once again that
                David Sedaris is a master of mystery and suspense.Or how about...when set on fire, most of us either
                fumble for our wallets or waste valuable time feeling sorry for ourselves. David Sedaris has studied
                this phenomenon, and his resulting insights may very well save your life. Author of the national
                bestsellers Should You Be Attacked By Snakes and If You Are Surrounded by Mean Ghosts, David Sedaris,
                with When You Are Engulfed in Flames, is clearly at the top of his game.Oh, all right...David Sedaris
                has written yet another book of essays (his sixth). Subjects include a parasitic worm that once lived in
                his mother-in-law's leg, an encounter with a dingo, and the recreational use of an external catheter.
                Also recounted is the buying of a human skeleton and the author's attempt to quit smoking In
                Tokyo.Master of nothing, at the dead center of his game, Sedaris proves that when you play with matches,
                you sometimes light the whole pack on fire. ...more

            <description>Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the
                gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We
                feel unqualified to do God’s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our
                weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Who You Think You Are is
                Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our
                dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do God’s work or
                to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God
                loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions
                you’ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not
                from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God’s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and
                your acceptance of God’s process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of
                who God is. It’s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life
                and learning to let God use you. It’s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes
                and meeting God there. After all, God can’t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you
                really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken
                people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is God’s Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the
                answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our
                success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God’s qualifying system is different than the world’s.
                So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick
                explores who God is as the great “I AM,” and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the
                story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The
                truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought
                possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified
                equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense
                of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct
                result of them. ...more

                thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate
                life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our A groundbreaking
                approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed
                expert in the field  Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is
                compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in
                chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even
                great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long
                intuited—that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didn’t Start with You
                builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine
                neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score.
                Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or
                silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in
                everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional
                and physical health than has ever before been understood.   As a pioneer in the field of inherited
                family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty
                years. It Didn’t Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core
                Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed
                through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or
                extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization,
                active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming
                life and health. It Didn’t Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding
                difficulties that in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the
                capacity to touch. ...more

            <description>Renowned social psychologist and creator of the "Stanford Prison Experiment," Philip Zimbardo
                explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things, how moral people can be seduced into acting
                immorally, and what this says about the line separating good from evil.The Lucifer Effect explains

                psychologist and creator of the "Stanford Prison Experiment," Philip Zimbardo explores the mechanisms
                that make good people do bad things, how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally, and what
                this says about the line separating good from evil.The Lucifer Effect explains how—and the myriad
                reasons why—we are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side.” Drawing on examples from history as
                well as his own trailblazing research, Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can
                work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women. Here, for the first time and in detail,
                Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of
                college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock
                prison environment. Within a week, the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were
                transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the
                psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a
                variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding
                American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held
                notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system
                contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around. ...more

            <description>Dr. Jeanne Safer has dedicated much of her decades' long career in psychotherapy to exploring
                taboo subjects that we all think about in private but seldom discuss in public. From conflicted sibling
                relationships to the choice not to have children, Safer's work has always been unflinching in its aim to
                dive deep into topics that make most of us blush, but which are present Dr. Jeanne Safer has dedicated
                much of her decades' long career in psychotherapy to exploring taboo subjects that we all think about in
                private but seldom discuss in public. From conflicted sibling relationships to the choice not to have
                children, Safer's work has always been unflinching in its aim to dive deep into topics that make most of
                us blush, but which are present in all of our lives. In The Golden Condom, Safer turns her sharp and
                fearless eye to a subject perhaps more universal than any other-love in all its permutations.In The
                Golden Condom Safer interweaves her own experiences with those of a variety of memorable people,
                including her patients, telling a series of tales that investigate relationships--both healthy and
                toxic--that most of us don't escape life without experiencing at least once, including traumatic
                friendships, love after loss, unrequited or obsessional love and more. Never prescriptive and always
                entertaining, these stories will demolish any suspicion you might have that you're alone in navigating a
                turbulent romantic life, and will inspire you with the range of possibilities that exist to find love,
                however unconventional, and at any age. ...more

            <description>Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who
                rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh
                rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we
                discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes Benjamin Franklin is the
                Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from
                leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In
                bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin
                seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles.
                By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. He was,
                during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist,
                and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved
                by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical
                ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies
                and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of
                lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise.
                He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the
                Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the
                Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and
                philosophical pragmatism. But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually
                reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings,
                consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own
                persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. Through it all, he trusted the hearts
                and minds of his fellow "leather-aprons" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class
                values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a
                "dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people." Few of his fellow
                founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. In this colorful and
                intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a
                runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's
                tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his
                flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character
                and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century. ...more

            <description>One of only two patron saints of Italy, the other being St. Francis of Assisi, St. Catherine
                was ahead of her time. As a political powerhouse in late 14th century Europe, a time of war, social
                unrest and one of the worst natural disasters of all time--the plague, she worked for peace between
                Christians while campaigning for a holy crusade against Muslims. She was illiterat One of only two
                patron saints of Italy, the other being St. Francis of Assisi, St. Catherine was ahead of her time. As a
                political powerhouse in late 14th century Europe, a time of war, social unrest and one of the worst
                natural disasters of all time--the plague, she worked for peace between Christians while campaigning for
                a holy crusade against Muslims. She was illiterate but grew into a great writer by dictating to
                assistants. She was frail and punished herself mercilessly, often starving herself, while offering moral
                guidance and inspiration to kings, queens and popes.It's easy to see why feminists through the years
                have sought to claim the patronage of St. Catherine. From her refusal to marry to her assertion that her
                physical appearance was of no importance, the famous Saint is ripe for modern interpretation. She was a
                peacemaker during Siena's revolution of 1368, sometimes addressing thousands of people in squares and
                streets; she convinced Pope Gregory XI to return the papacy to Rome at a time when the Catholic Church
                was unraveling.How did this girl, the second-youngest of 25 children of a middle-class dyer, grow to
                become one of the most beloved spiritual figures of all time, a theological giant to rank alongside the
                likes of Thomas Aquinas? InSetting the World on Fire, Emling gives an intimate portrayal of this
                fascinating and revolutionary woman. ...more

            <description>“If everyone in the United States had the same qualities of loyalty and care and concern for
                others that Larry Taunton had, we'd be living in a much better society than we do.” ~ Christopher
                HitchensAt the time of his death, Christopher Hitchens was the most notorious atheist in the world. And
                yet, all was not as it seemed. “Nobody is not a divided self, of course,” heonce “If everyone in the
                United States had the same qualities of loyalty and care and concern for others that Larry Taunton had,
                we'd be living in a much better society than we do.” ~ Christopher HitchensAt the time of his death,
                Christopher Hitchens was the most notorious atheist in the world.  And yet, all was not as it seemed.
                 “Nobody is not a divided self, of course,” he once told an interviewer, “but I think it’s rather strong
                in my case.”   Hitchens was a man of many contradictions:   a Marxist in youth who longed for acceptance
                among the social elites; a peacenik who revered the military; a champion of the Left who was nonetheless
                pro-life, pro-war-on-terror, and after 9/11 something of a neocon; and while he railed against God on
                stage, he maintained meaningful—though largely hidden from public view—friendships with evangelical
                Christians like Francis Collins, Douglas Wilson, and the author Larry Alex Taunton.  In The Faith of
                Christopher Hitchens, Taunton offers a very personal perspective of one of our most interesting and most
                misunderstood public figures.  Writing with genuine compassion and without compromise, Taunton traces
                Hitchens’s spiritual and intellectual development from his decision as a teenager to reject belief in
                God to his rise to prominence as one of the so-called “Four Horsemen” of the New Atheism.  While
                Hitchens was, in the minds of many Christians, Public Enemy Number One, away from the lights
                and the cameras a warm friendship flourished between Hitchens and the author; a friendship
                that culminated in not one, but two lengthy road trips where, after Hitchens’s diagnosis of esophageal
                cancer, they studied the Bible together.  The Faith of Christopher Hitchens gives us a candid glimpse
                into the inner life of this intriguing, sometimes maddening, and unexpectedly vulnerable man.“This book
                should be read by every atheist and theist passionate about the truth.”--Michael Shermer, publisher,

            <description>An intimate portrait of Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams, who witnessed
                firsthand the greatest transformations of her time Born in London to an American father and a British
                mother on the eve of the Revolutionary War, Louisa Catherine Johnson was raised in circumstances very
                different from the New England upbringing of the future president John Quincy An intimate portrait of
                Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams, who witnessed firsthand the greatest
                transformations of her time    Born in London to an American father and a British mother on the eve of
                the Revolutionary War, Louisa Catherine Johnson was raised in circumstances very different from the New
                England upbringing of the future president John Quincy Adams, whose life had been dedicated to public
                service from the earliest age. And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their
                often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.  They lived in Prussia,
                Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White
                House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she
                lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or
                out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for granted—they were Adamses; they
                were Americans—but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who
                forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice.
                That voice resonates still.  In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa
                Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a
                remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is
                a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more

                house. Cal discovers a hidden basement room where it’s clear that salacious activities have taken
                place—as well as evidence of missing DVDs. But his investigation soon becomes more complicated when he
                realizes it may not be discs the thief was actually interested in....   Meanwhile, Detective Barry
                Duckworth is still trying to solve two murders—one of which is three years old—he believes are
                connected, since each featured a similar distinctive wound.   As the lies begin to unravel, Cal is
                headed straight into the heart of a dark secret as his search uncovers more startling truths about
                Promise Falls. And when yet another murder happens, Cal and Barry are both driven to pursue their
                investigations, no matter where they lead. Evil deeds long thought buried are about to haunt the
                residents of this town—as the sins of the past and present collide with terrifying results. ...more

                and believing it are two different things. Katherine…When Brady shows up on a Harley, looking like an
                avenging angel—six feet, three inches of chiseled muscle, eyes the color of wild sage, and sun-kissed
                skin emblazoned with tattoos—I’m not sure if I should fall at his feet or run like hell. Because if I

                we spend together trying to forget the heartache that brought us here. I promise him it won’t mean
                anything, that I won’t fall in love. I shouldn’t make promises I can’t keep.* Author's note: Due to

                become a modern classic of travel literature. Here Theroux recounts his early adventures on an unusual

                Antonson sets his adventurous compass on Mount Ararat, exploring the region’s long history, religious
                mysteries, and complex politics.Mount Ararat is the most fabled mountain in the world. For millennia
                this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah’s Ark following the Great
                Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and
                Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountain’s nearly 17,000-foot
                summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of
                their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether
                tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its
                unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurds’ ambitions for their own nation’s borders, which some say
                should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark is one man’s odyssey, a tale told
                through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of
                Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian
                and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows
                and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating
                area of the world. ...more

                Italy, something changes. Gwen begins to live in the moment--skipping down stone staircases in Capri,
                running her fingers over a glacier in view of the Matterhorn, racing through the Louvre, and
                taste-testing pastries at a Marseilles cafe. Reveling in every new experience--especially her attraction
                to a charismatic British physics professor--Gwen discovers that the ancient wonders around her are
                nothing compared to the renaissance unfolding within. . . "A thinking woman's love story, it swept me

                Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hammerfest, the
                northernmost town on the continent, to Istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in Bill Bryson's first

                window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson
                takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously

                than a page on each location. Each entry lists exactly where to find the spot (e.g. Moorea is located
                "12 miles/19 km northwest of Tahiti; 10 minutes by air, 1 hour by boat") and when to go (e.g., if you
                want to check out The Complete Fly Fisher hotel in Montana, "May and Sept.-Oct. offer productive angling
